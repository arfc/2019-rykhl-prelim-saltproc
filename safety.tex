\section{Safety and operational parameters} \label{sec:safety-param}
The proposed work will investigate the following safety and operational 
parameters: the temperature reactivity feedback coefficient, reactivity worth 
of the control rods, and power axial offset. Dynamics of these parameters will 
be investigated for the \gls{TAP} concept during lifetime-long operation and 
short-term load-following transient. Validation against previous work 
mentioned in section~\ref{sec:saf-par-literature} will be performed for 
confidence building.
\subsection{Temperature coefficient of reactivity}
The main physical principle underlying the reactor temperature feedback is an 
expansion of heated material. When the fuel salt temperature increases, the 
density of the salt decreases, but at the same time, the total volume of fuel 
salt in the core remains constant because it is bounded by the vessel. When 
the moderator rod temperatures increase, the density of zirconium hydride 
decreases, creating additional space for fuel salt. 

Chapter 2, equation~\ref{eq:feedback} defined Total or Isothermal Temperature 
Coefficient (ITC) which expresses the dependence of the core reactivity on the 
combined effects of fuel and moderator temperature. However, fuel and 
moderator temperature are rarely equal because fuel heats up much faster than 
the moderator; thus, the fuel temperature coefficient (FTC) and the moderator 
temperature coefficient (MTC) should be calculated separately. In the base 
case simulation in this work, the fuel salt and the moderator temperatures are 
fixed at 900K, which is an operational temperature in the core. To determine 
the fuel salt temperature coefficient (FTC), I will perturb the fuel salt 
temperature to 800K and 1000K while fixing the moderator temperature at 900K 
(base case). Likewise, the moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) will be 
found by perturbing the moderator temperature from 900K to 800K and 1000K, 
while the fuel temperature is fixed at 900K. 

The range of temperature perturbation for the temperature coefficient  
calculation has been selected based on operational parameters. The \gls{TAP} 
\gls{MSR} operates between 773 and 973K (500-700$^o$C), which is far below the 
salt boiling point of approximately 1473K. The salt freezes if the temperature 
drops below 773K. At the other end of the temperature spectrum, the 
temperature higher than 973K passively melt a freeze plug, which drains the 
fuel salt from the reactor vessel to the drain tanks. The drain tanks have a 
subcritical configuration with a large free surface area to readily dissipate 
heat by passive cooling \cite{transatomic_power_corporation_technical_2016}. 
Thus, calculating temperature coefficients in the temperature range from 800 
to 1000K will capture  the outcomes of most
accident transients.

Fuel and Moderator Temperature Coefficients for the temperature in the range 
from 800 to 900K would be useful for analyzing the following transients 
related to sudden fuel salt cooling: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item increase in heat removal by the secondary system;
	\item increase in the fuel salt flow rate;
	\item planned reactor shutdown.
\end{itemize}
Temperature coefficients for the temperature in the range from 900 to 1000K 
would be used for transients related with salt overheating: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) ;
	\item loss-of-flow accident (LOFA);
	\item loss of ultimate heat sink;
	\item  station blackout (SBO).
\end{itemize}
Thus, temperature coefficients will be calculated separately for above 900K 
and below 900K. My dissertation will include the following cases: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item FTC (moderator rods temperature is fixed at 900K):
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
			\item temperature of the salt between 900 and 1000K;
			\item temperature of the salt between 900 and 800K.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item MTC (the fuel salt temperature is fixed at 900K): 
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
			\item temperature of the moderator between 900 and 1000K;
			\item temperature of the fuel between 900 and 800K.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item ITC: 
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
			\item whole reactor temperature between 900 and 1000K;
			\item whole reactor temperature between 900 and 800K;
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
In the first case, changes in the fuel temperature will impact cross section 
temperature (Doppler broadening) and fuel density, but the geometry is 
unchanged because the fuel is a liquid. The density of fuel salt 
changes with respect to temperature as follows \cite{janz_molten_1974}:
\begin{align}\label{eq:salt-den}
\rho_{salt}(T[K]) &= 6.105 - 12.720\times10^4 T \quad [g/cm^3]
\end{align}
The uncertainty in the salt density calculated using 
Equation~\ref{eq:salt-den} is approximately 0.036 $g/cm^3$ at 900K.
In contrast, when the moderator temperature is changing, the density, cross 
section temperature, and the geometry are also changing due to thermal 
expansion of the solid zirconium hydride (ZrH$_{1.66}$) rods. Accordingly, the 
new moderator density and sizes will be calculated using a linear temperature 
expansion coefficient of $2.734\times10^{-5}$K$^{-1}$ 
\cite{yamanaka_thermal_1999}. A new geometry input for Serpent 2, which takes 
into account displacement of the moderator  surfaces, will be created based on 
this information. Finally, the temperature coefficient for each case will be 
calculated separately as follows:
\begin{align}
\alpha &= \frac{k_{eff}(T_{i+1}) - k_{eff}(T_i)}{k_{eff}(T_{i+1}) 
k_{eff}(T_{i}) (T_{i+1} - T_i)}
\intertext{where}
k_{eff} &= \mbox{effective multiplication factor} \nonumber \\
T_i &= \mbox{fuel salt temperature in (800K, 1000K).} \nonumber
\end{align}
By propagating the $k_{eff}$ statistical error provided by Serpent 2, 
uncertainty for each temperature coefficient will be obtained using the  
formula:
\begin{align}
\delta\alpha &= \abs{\frac{1}{T_{i+1} - T_i}} \sqrt{\frac{\delta 
k_{eff}^2(T_{i+1})}{k_{eff}^4(T_{i+1})}  
+ \frac{\delta k_{eff}^2(T_i)}{k_{eff}^4(T_i)}}
\intertext{where}
\delta k_{eff} &= \mbox{statistical error for $k_{eff}$ from Serpent output.} 
\nonumber
\end{align}
Notably, other sources of uncertainty are neglected, such as cross section 
measurement error and approximations inherent in the equations of the state 
providing both the salt and moderator density dependence on temperature. 

\subsection{Reactivity control system rod worth}
In the \gls{TAP} concept, control rods perform two main functions: to shut 
down the reactor at any point during operation by introducing sufficient 
negative reactivity and to control the excess of reactivity after moderator 
rod reconfiguration during regular maintenance. In an accident, the control 
rods would be dropped down into the core. The reactivity worth of the control 
rods will be calculated for various positions to separately estimate the worth 
of each control rod, and the whole reactivity control system. Finally, control 
rod with the maximum worth will be localized to conduct basic safety test: at 
\gls{BOL} the reactor should not startup if a single rod (maximum worth rod) 
is accidentally ejected from the \gls{TAP} core.

The reactivity worth of the single control rod is defined as:
\begin{align}
& \qquad\qquad\qquad CRW = (k_{eff}^W - k_{eff}^I)\times 10^5 \;\; [pcm]
\intertext{where}
k_{eff}^W &= \mbox{effective multiplication factor when control rod is fully 
withdrawn} \nonumber \\
k_{eff}^I &= \mbox{effective multiplication factor when control rod is fully 
inserted} \nonumber 
\end{align}
The statistical error of the  reactivity worth will be obtained using formula:
\begin{align}
\delta CRW &= \sqrt{(\delta k_{eff}^W)^2 + (\delta k_{eff}^I)^2}
\intertext{where}
\delta k_{eff}^{W}, \delta k_{eff}^{I}, &= \mbox{$k_{eff}$ statistical error 
from Serpent output.} 
\nonumber
\end{align}

\subsection{Axial Offset} \label{sec:axial-offset}
\gls{AOA} refers to a neutron flux depression in the top of a nuclear reactor 
core, which complicates the reactor operation. This problem occurs in  
\gls{PWR} plants and leads to a variety of problems: increased local power 
peaking factors, lower than expected burnup and decreased control rod worth.
The Axial Offset is defined as:
\begin{align}
& \qquad\qquad\qquad A/O  = \frac{p_{top} - p_{bottom}}{p_{top} + p_{bottom}}
	\intertext{where}
p_{top}, p_{bottom} &= \mbox{fraction of rated power in a top and bottom half 
of the core.} \nonumber
\end{align}

For the case of the \gls{TAP} \gls{MSR}, off-gas system components (e.g., 
sparger, entrainment separator) introduce small bubbles of inert gas 
(helium) into the fuel salt during operation. These helium bubbles entering  
into the core would then introduce unpredictable reactivity. Moreover, the 
diameter of the bubbles would increase as they rise from the bottom to the top 
of the core because of approximately the 140$^{o}$C temperature difference 
between the reactor inlet and outlet. To take into account the effect of the 
gas present in the fuel salt, I will split the reactor core model into a few 
axial regions with different corresponding salt density 
(figure~\ref{fig:axial-offset}).

The ideal gas law must be employed to find the density of the fuel salt with 
gas bubbles\footnote{Assuming we know the bubble number and size from the 
component design.} 
in it:
\begin{align}
PV &= nRT 
\intertext{where}
P &= \mbox{pressure of the gas} \nonumber \\
V &= \mbox{volume of the gas} \nonumber \\
n &= \mbox{number of moles of the gas} \nonumber \\
R &= 8.31 \frac{J}{K\cdot mol} \nonumber \\
T &= \mbox{temperature of the gas.} \nonumber
\end{align}
Assuming the pressure in the vessel remains fixed and  the number of moles 
of helium is constant, the helium volume change related to temperature 
change can be defined as:
\begin{align}\label{eq:he-vol-change}
&\qquad\qquad\qquad V^{He}_i = \frac{V^{He}_0}{T_0} T_i
\intertext{where}
V^{He}_0, V^{He}_i &= \mbox{total He volume in the salt with temperature 
T$_0$, 
	T$_i$} \nonumber \\
T_0, T_i &= \mbox{temperature of the salt in a lower and i$^{th}$ axial 
layer.} 
\nonumber
\end{align}
\begin{figure}[bth!] % replace 't' with 'b' to 
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{axial_offset.png}
	\caption{Preliminary schematic view showing the \gls{TAP} model divided to 
		multiple axial layers with different densities of the salt. This model 
		will assume a linear temperature growth from the bottom to the top.}
	\label{fig:axial-offset}
\end{figure}

Using equations~\ref{eq:salt-den},\ref{eq:he-vol-change}, density of the  
salt/helium mixture in each axial layer ($\rho_i$) will be calculated. 
Finally, a Serpent 2 calculation will be performed for the model with 
non-uniform axial density distribution in the fuel salt to determine axial 
neutron flux distribution and axial offset (A/O) in the \gls{TAP} core.

\section{Preliminary results}\label{sec:safety-param-res}
Temperature coefficients and control rod worth were calculated for the 
\gls{TAP} reactor at startup as discussed in section~\ref{sec:safety-param}.

\subsection{Temperature coefficients and rod worth at BOL}
Table~\ref{tab:tcoef} summarizes temperature effects on reactivity in the 
\gls{TAP} core calculated for the initial fuel salt composition. The fuel 
temperature coefficient is $-0.693$ and $-0.116$ pcm $\Delta k/k\cdot K^{-1}$ 
when perturbing the salt temperature from 900K to 800K and from 900K to 1000K, 
respectively. The MTC and ITC are negative and relatively large for both 
cases. All three temperature coefficients when perturbing from 900K to 
1000K did not match coefficients when perturbing from 900K to 800K because 
cross sections are nonlinear with temperature.

\end{table}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
These reactivity coefficients will change most likely during operation due to 
changes in the neutron spectrum, \gls{SVF}, core geometry, amount of fuel in 
the core and fuel composition. The FTC is expected to be more negative 
during operation as the spectrum thermalizes due to additional, retained  
fission products and actinides building up in the fuel salt. Temperature 
coefficients calculations will be repeated at middle-of-life and end-of-life 
to capture changes in these characteristics.

A configuration of 25 control rods (Figure~\ref{fig:tap-serpent-plan}) 
provides a reactivity worth of $1110\pm9.7$ pcm (1.1\%) at \gls{BOL}. The 
control rod worth is expected to become more negative during operation 
because the spectrum thermalizes and many fission product poisons exhibit 
larger absorption cross sections in the thermal energy range. At the same 
time, that effect would be counteracted by actinide (particularly, plutonium) 
accumulation in the core. Thus, control rod worth change during the reactor 
operation must be estimated.
