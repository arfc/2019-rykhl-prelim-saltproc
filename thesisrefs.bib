	abstract = {The molten-salt-cooled Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (AHTR) is a new reactor concept designed to provide very high-temperature (750 to 1000°C) heat to enable efficient low-cost thermochemical production of hydrogen (H2) or production of electricity. This paper provides an initial description and technical analysis of its key features. The proposed AHTR uses coated-particle graphite-matrix fuel similar to that used in high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs), such as the General Atomics gas turbine-modular helium reactor. However, unlike the HTGRs, the AHTR uses a molten-salt coolant and a pool configuration, similar to that of the General Electric Super Power Reactor Inherently Safe Module (S-PRISM) liquid-metal reactor. Because the boiling points for molten fluoride salts are near 1400°C, the reactor can operate at very high temperatures and atmospheric pressure. For thermochemical H2 production, the heat is delivered at the required near-constant high temperature and low pressure. For electricity production, a multireheat helium Brayton (gas-turbine) cycle, with efficiencies {\textgreater}50\%, is used. The low-pressure molten-salt coolant, with its high heat capacity and natural circulation heat transfer capability, creates the potential for robust safety (including fully passive decay-heat removal) and improved economics with passive safety systems that allow higher power densities and scaling to large reactor sizes [{\textgreater}1000 MW(electric)].},

The initial goal was an aircraft propulsion reactor, and a molten fluoride-fueled Aircraft Reactor Experiment was operated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1954. In 1956, the objective shifted to civilian nuclear power, and reactor concepts were developed using a circulating UF4-ThF4 fuel, graphite moderator, and Hastelloy N pressure boundary. The program culminated in the successful operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment in 1965 to 1969. By then the Atomic Energy Commission’s goals had shifted to breeder development; the molten salt program supported on-site reprocessing development and study of various reactor arrangements that had potential to breed. Some commercial and foreign interest contributed to the program which, however, was terminated by the government in 1976. The current status of the technology and prospects for revived interest are summarized.},

	abstract = {The concept of the molten salt reactor (MSR) refuses to go away. The Generation-IV process lists the MSR as one of the six concepts to be considered for extending fuel resources. Good fuel utilization and good economics are required to meet the often-cited goal of 10 TWe globally and 1 TWe for the US by non-carbon energy sources in this century by nuclear fission. Strong incentives for the molten salt reactor design are its good fuel utilization, good economics, amazing fuel flexibility and promised large benefits. It can:• use thorium or uranium; • be designed with lots of graphite to have a fairly thermal neutron spectrum or without graphite moderator to have an epithermal neutron spectrum; • fission uranium isotopes and plutonium isotopes; • produces less long-lived wastes than today’s reactors by a factor of 10–100; • operate with non-weapon grade fissile fuel, or in suitable sites it can operate with enrichment between reactor-grade and weapon grade fissile fuel; • be a breeder or near breeder; • operate at temperature \&gt;1100 °C if carbon composites are successfully developed. Enhancing 232U content in the uranium to over 500 ppm makes the fuel undesirable for weapons, but it should not detract from its economic use in liquid fuel reactors: a big advantage in nonproliferation. Economics of the MSR are enhanced by operating at low pressure and high temperature and may even lead to the preferred route to hydrogen production. The cost of the electricity produced from low enriched fuel averaged over the life of the entire process, has been predicted to be about 10\% lower than that from LWRs, and 20\% lower for high-enriched fuel, with uncertainties of about 10\%. The development cost has been estimated at about 1 B\$ (e.g., a 100 M\$/year base program for 10 years) not including construction of a series of reactors leading up to the deployment of multiple commercial units at an assumed cost of 9 B\$ (450 M\$/year over 20 years). A benefit of liquid fuel is that smaller power reactors can faithfully test features of larger reactors, thereby reducing the number of steps to commercial deployment. Assuming electricity is worth \$ 50 per MWe h, then 50 years of 10 TWe power level would be worth 200 trillion dollars. If the MSR could be developed and proven for 10 B\$ and would save 10\% over its alternative, the total savings over 50 years would be 20 trillion dollars: a good return on investment even considering discounted future savings. The incentives for the molten salt reactor are so strong and its relevance to our energy policy and national security are so compelling that one asks, “Why has the reactor not already been developed?”},

The most active development period however was between the mid 1950s and early 1970s at Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) and any new re-examination of this concept must bear in mind the far different priorities then in place. High breeding ratios and short doubling times were paramount and this guided the evolution of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) program. As the inherent advantages of the molten salt concept have become apparent to an increasing number of researchers worldwide it is important to not simply look to continue where ORNL left off but to return to basics in order to offer the best design using updated goals and abilities. A major potential change to the traditional Single Fluid, MSBR design and a subject of this presentation is a return to the mode of operation that ORNL proposed for the majority of its MSR program. That being the Two Fluid design in which separate salts are used for fissile 233UF4 and fertile ThF4. Oak Ridge abandoned this promising route due to what was known as the “plumbing problem”. It will be shown that a simple yet crucial modification to core geometry can solve this problem and enable the many advantages of the Two Fluid design. In addition, another very promising route laid out by ORNL was simplified Single Fluid converter reactors that could obtain far superior lifetime uranium utilization than LWR or CANDU without the need for any fuel processing beyond simple chemistry control. Updates and potential improvements to this very attractive concept will also be explored.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-physics modelling (MPM) approach developed for the study of the dynamics of the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which has been reconsidered as one of the future nuclear power plants in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum for its several potentialities. The proposed multi-physics modelling is aimed at the description of the coupling between heat transfer, fluid dynamics and neutronics characteristics in a typical MSR core channel, taking into account the spatial effects of the most relevant physical quantities. In particular, as far as molten salt thermo-hydrodynamics is concerned, Navier–Stokes equations are used with the turbulence treatment according to the RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes) scheme, while the heat transfer is taken into account through the energy balance equations for the fuel salt and the graphite. As far as neutronics is concerned, the two-group diffusion theory is adopted, where the group constants (computed by means of the neutron transport code NEWT of SCALE 5.1) are included into the model in order to describe the neutron flux and the delayed neutron precursor distributions, the system time constants, and the temperature feedback effects of both graphite and fuel salt. The developed MPM approach is implemented in the unified simulation environment offered by COMSOL Multiphysics®, and is applied to study the behaviour of the system in steady-state conditions and under several transients (i.e., reactivity insertion due to control rod movements, fuel mass flow rate variations due to the change of the pump working conditions, presence of periodic perturbations), pointing out some advantages offered with respect to the conventional approaches employed in literature for the MSRs.},

	abstract = {The thesis work investigates the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) technology as a possible route to combine the potential advantages of thorium use in Fast Reactors (FR) with the fuel cycle advantages fostered by a liquid fuel. The MSFR emerges as a promising reactor for its capability to operate as a flexible conversion ratio reactor. It shows good performances as U-233 breeder, though uncertainties exist on the U-233 capture cross-section in the neutron energy range of interest for the MSFR. Operation as a self-sustaining reactor fosters low consumption of natural resources, very limited waste generation, and simplified fuel management thanks to the liquid fuel. The MSFR also shows promising features in terms of radioactive waste transmutation thanks to the liquid fuel, the high specific power and the relatively hard spectrum. Safety aspects are investigated through analysis of the reactor safety parameters, and via prediction of the new reactor steady-state after accidental transient initiators. The MSFR inherent safety appears comparable to that of traditional FRs, especially considering its capability to withstand all major double-fault accidents. In addition, the MSFR presents only negative reactivity feedback coefficients, which is a unique feature among fast-spectrum reactors. The system thermal-hydraulics is also investigated in view of the internal heat generation in the working fluid. A correlation is proposed and application to the MSFR allows to exclude major impacts of decay heat on the MSFR out-of-core components, with a note of caution on the design of channels with low velocities and/or large diameters. In addition, a multi-physics model is developed to investigate the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the core, showing some points of enhancement needed in the current MSFR conceptual design. The same model is employed for investigating the reactor transient response to major accidental events, confirming the MSFR promising safety features pointed out with simpler approaches, but suggesting also possible problems related to the quick fuel temperature rise in case of a loss of heat sink.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors (MSRs) represent a class of reactors that use liquid salt, usually fluoride based or chloride based, as either a coolant with a solid fuel (such as fluoride salt–cooled high-temperature reactors) or as a combined coolant and fuel with the fuel dissolved in a carrier salt. For liquid-fueled MSRs, the salt can be processed online or in a batch mode to allow for removal of fission products as well as for introduction of fissile fuel and fertile materials during reactor operation. The MSR is most commonly associated with the 233U/thorium fuel cycle, as the nuclear properties of 233U combined with the online removal of parasitic absorbers enable the design of a thermal-spectrum breeder reactor. However, MSR concepts have been developed using all neutron energy spectra (thermal, intermediate, fast, and mixed-spectrum zoned concepts) and with a variety of fuels including uranium, thorium, plutonium, and minor actinides. Early MSR work was supported by a significant research and development (R\&D) program that resulted in two experimental systems operating at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1950s and 1960s: the Aircraft Reactor Experiment and the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Subsequent design studies in the 1970s focusing on thermal-spectrum thorium-fueled systems established reference concepts for two major design variants: (1) a molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) with multiple configurations that could breed additional fissile material or maintain self-sustaining operation and (2) a denatured molten salt reactor (DMSR) with enhanced proliferation resistance. MSRs have been selected as one of the Generation IV systems, and development activity has been seen in fast-spectrum MSRs, waste-burning MSRs, and MSRs fueled with low-enriched uranium as well as in more traditional thorium fuel cycle–based MSRs. This paper provides a historical background of MSR R\&D efforts, surveys and summarizes many of the recent developments, and provides analysis comparing thorium-based MSRs by way of example.},

	abstract = {This introduction to heat transfer offers advanced undergraduate and graduate engineering students a solid foundation in the subjects of conduction, convection, radiation, and phase-change, in addition to the related topic of mass transfer. A staple of engineering courses around the world for more than three decades, it has been revised and updated regularly by the authors, a pair of recognized experts in the field. The text addresses the implications, limitations, and meanings of many aspects of heat transfer, connecting the subject to its real-world applications and developing students' insight into related phenomena.  Three introductory chapters form a minicourse in heat transfer, covering all of the subjects discussed in detail in subsequent chapters. This unique and effective feature introduces heat exchangers early in the development, rather than at the end. The authors also present a novel and simplified method for dimensional analysis, and they capitalize on the similarity of natural convection and film condensation to develop these two topics in a parallel manner. Worked examples and end-of-chapter exercises appear throughout the book, along with well-drawn, illuminating figures.},

	abstract = {Conventional coupling paradigms currently used to couple different physics components in reactor analysis problems can be inconsistent in their treatment of the nonlinear terms due to the operator-split (OS) strategies employed. This leads to the usage of small time steps to maintain accuracy requirements, thereby increasing the overall computational time. This paper proposes some remedies to OS techniques that can restore consistency in the coupling of the nonlinear terms and explores high-order mono-block nonlinearly consistent techniques with time step control. The performance of the methods was studied for several transient scenarios using a 0D point-kinetics/thermal-hydraulics lumped model and a 1D neutronics/heat conduction/enthalpy balance model. The results prove that consistent approximations can be made to enhance the overall accuracy in conventional codes with simple nonintrusive techniques. Additionally, an analysis of a mono-block coupling strategy (without having recourse to an OS strategy) is carried out to assess automated time stepping control using higher order Implicit Runge–Kutta (IRK) schemes. The conclusions from these results indicate that nonlinearly consistent adaptive time stepping methods can provide better accuracy and reliability in the solution fields than constant time stepping methods, even for transients with rapid and discontinuous variations.},

Their possibilities of usage as a coolant, heat transfer fluid or heat storage substrate, require thermo-hydrodynamic refined calculations. Many researchers are using simulation techniques, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for their projects or conceptual designs. The aim of this work is providing a review of basic properties (density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and heat capacity) of the most common and referred salt mixtures. After checking data, tabulated and graphical outputs are given in order to offer the most suitable available values to be used as input parameters for other calculations or simulations. The reviewed values show a general scattering in characterization, mainly in thermal properties. This disagreement suggests that, in several cases, new studies must be started (and even new measurement techniques should be developed) to obtain accurate values.},

	abstract = {The development of spatial dynamics code for molten salt reactors (MSRs) is reported in this paper. The graphite-moderated channel type MSR – one of the ‘Generation IV’ concepts – was selected for the numerical simulation. It has several peculiarities (e.g. the drift of delayed neutrons precursors), which disable the use of standard dynamics codes. Therefore, the own DYN3D-MSR code was developed. It is based on the light water reactor code DYN3D and it allows transients simulation by 3D neutronics and parallel channel thermal-hydraulics. The neutronics and thermal-hydraulics were modified for the MSR peculiarities, where the experience from DYN1D-MSR development was exploited. The code was validated on experimental results from the MSRE experiment done in Oak Ridge National Laboratory and by the comparison with other codes especially with the 1D version. However, by the 3D code transients can be simulated, where space-dependant efforts are relevant, like local blockage of fuel channels or local temperature perturbations.},

	abstract = {As part of a nuclear fuel cycle evaluation and screening (E\&S) study, widely ranging thorium fuel cycle options were evaluated, and their performance characteristics and challenges to implementation were compared to those of other nuclear fuel cycle options based on criteria specified by the Nuclear Energy Office of the U.S. Department of Energy. The evaluated nuclear fuel cycles included the once-through, limited, and continuous recycle options using critical or externally driven nuclear energy systems. The E\&S study found that the continuous recycle of 233U/Th in fuel cycles using either thermal or fast reactors is an attractive promising fuel cycle option with high effective fuel resource utilization and low waste generation, but they did not perform quite as well as the continuous recycle of Pu/U using a fast critical system, which was identified as one of the most promising fuel cycle options in the E\&S study. This is because compared to their uranium counterparts, the thorium-based systems tended to have higher radioactivity in the short term ( 100 years postirradiation), because of differences in the fission product yield curves, and in the long term (100 000 years postirradiation), because of the decay of 233U and daughters, and because of higher mass flow rates due to lower discharge burnups. Some of the thorium-based systems also require enriched uranium support, which tends to be detrimental to resource utilization and waste generation metrics. Finally, similar to the need to develop recycle fuel fabrication, fuels separations, and fast reactors for the most promising options using Pu/U recycle, the future thorium-based fuel cycle options with continuous recycle would also require such capabilities; however, their deployment challenges are expected to be greater since past development of such facilities has not reached a comparable level of maturity.},

	abstract = {The quasi-static method for the neutron kinetics of nuclear reactors is generalized for application to neutron multiplying systems fueled by a fluid multiplying material, typically a mixture of fissile molten salts. The method is derived by the application of factorization formulae for both the neutron density and the delayed precursor concentrations and the projection of the balance equations upon a weighting function. A physically meaningful weight can be assumed as the solution of the adjoint model, which is constructed for the situation considered, including delayed neutrons. The quasi-static scheme is then applied to calculations of some transients for a typical configuration of a molten-salt reactor, in a multigroup diffusion model with a one-dimensional slug-flow velocity field. The physical features associated to the motion of the fissile material are highlighted.},

	abstract = {The fluoride salt–cooled high-temperature reactor (FHR) with a nuclear air-Brayton combined cycle (NACC) and firebrick resistance-heated energy storage (FIRES) is a new reactor and plant concept. The development of a new reactor is a large undertaking that requires a strong commercial case and a strong basis for government support to enable commercialization. The goals are (1) increase plant revenue by 50\% to 100\% relative to base-load nuclear plants with capital costs similar to light water reactors, (2) enable a zero-carbon nuclear renewable electricity grid, (3) no potential for major fuel failure and thus no potential for major radionuclide off-site releases in a beyond-design-basis accident, and (4) offer a pathway to more advanced energy systems. The approaches to achieve those goals are described herein.The FHR uses liquid-salt coolants originally developed for molten salt reactors (MSRs) where the fuel is dissolved in the coolant. However, in the FHR the fuel is not dissolved in the coolant. Instead, the FHR uses graphite-based high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) coated-particle fuel. This combination enables delivering heat to the power cycle between 600°C and 700°C that, in turn, enables the FHR to couple to NACC. Using an air-Brayton power cycle enables the FHR to operate as a base-load reactor and produce added electricity in a peaking mode with the addition of auxiliary heat (natural gas, stored heat, or hydrogen). The auxiliary heat-to-electricity production is a thermodynamic topping cycle with efficiencies of 66\%. Because an FHR with NACC is more efficient in converting natural gas into peak electricity than a stand-alone natural gas plant (60\%), it can economically compete with a natural gas plant for peak electricity production because it uses less fuel. NACC can also incorporate FIRES heat storage that enables buying electricity at low prices to later sell electricity at high prices. For every 100 MW(electric) of base-load capacity, the station output can vary from minus several hundred megawatts to +242 MW(electric) because of the capabilities of the NACC with FIRES. The FHR can be built in different sizes.The use of high-temperature liquid-salt cooling and coated-particle fuel enables near-term reactor designs where large-scale fuel failure cannot occur, and thus, large-scale off-site releases of radionuclides cannot occur. Under extreme accident conditions decay heat can be passively conducted to the environment at temperatures below fuel failure temperatures and thus avoid the potential for large-scale radionuclide releases.The FHR is the gateway technology to several advanced salt-cooled reactor systems that have additional capabilities. The MSR can be designed to enable breeding and actinide waste burning. New high-magnetic-field fusion systems may require liquid-salt cooling. The FHR would provide the required salt and power cycle technology for these advanced reactors. There are significant development challenges. The United States has a competitive advantage in developing the FHR because it leads in gas turbine technology, high-temperature materials, and HTGR fuels.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the development, validation, and results of a three-dimensional, time- dependent, coupled-neutronics–thermal-hydraulic calculational scheme for channel-type molten salt re- actors (MSRs). The reactor physics part is based on diffusion theory, extended by a term representing the flow of the fuel through the core. The calculation of the temperature field is done by modeling all fuel channels, which are coupled to each other by a three-dimensional heat conduction equation. For the purpose of validation, the results of the MSR Experiment (MSRE) natural-circulation experiment and the thermal feedback coefficients of the reactor have been calculated and compared.
With the aid of a code system developed to implement this scheme, calculations were carried out for the normal operating state of the MSRE and some debris-induced channel-blocking-incident transients. In the case of the MSRE, it is shown that the severity of such an incident strongly depends on the degree of channel blocking and that high-temperature gradients in the moderator can connect thermally the adjacent fuel channels. Results are included for an unblocking transient (i.e., the debris suddenly exits the core, and the fuel flow reverts to the normal operating pattern), and it was demonstrated that during the unblocking large power peaks can be induced.},

	abstract = {A molten salt reactor (MSR) is a class of generation IV nuclear fission reactor in which the primary nuclear reactor coolant, or even the fuel itself, is a molten salt mixture. MSRs can run at higher temperatures than water-cooled reactors for a higher thermodynamic efficiency, while staying at low vapour pressure.
The nuclear fuel may be solid or dissolved in the coolant. In many designs the nuclear fuel dissolved in the coolant is uranium tetrafluoride (UF4). The fluid becomes critical in a graphite core that serves as the moderator. Some solid-fuel designs propose ceramic fuel dispersed in a graphite matrix, with the molten salt providing low pressure, high temperature cooling. The salts are much more efficient than compressed helium (another potential coolant in Generation IV reactor designs) at removing heat from the core, reducing the need for pumping and piping and reducing the core size.
The concept was established in the 1950s. The early Aircraft Reactor Experiment (1954) was primarily motivated by the small size that the design could provide, while the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (1965–1969) was a prototype for a thorium fuel cycle breeder reactor nuclear power plant. The increased research into Generation IV reactor designs included a renewed interest in the technology.},

	abstract = {Properties of the two-phase hydride U0.3ZrH1.6 pertinent to performance as a nuclear fuel for LWRs are reviewed. Much of the available data come from the Space Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP) program of 4 decades ago and from the more restricted data base prepared for the TRIGA research reactors some 3 decades back. Transport, mechanical, thermal and chemical properties are summarized. A principal difference between oxide and hydride fuels is the high thermal conductivity of the latter. This feature greatly decreases the temperature drop over the fuel during operation, thereby reducing the release of fission gases to the fraction due only to recoil. However, very unusual early swelling due to void formation around the uranium particles has been observed in hydride fuels. Avoidance of this source of swelling limits the maximum fuel temperature to ∼650 °C (the design limit recommended by the fuel developer is 750 °C). To satisfy this temperature limitation, the fuel-cladding gap needs to be bonded with a liquid metal instead of helium. Because the former has a thermal conductivity ∼100 times larger than the latter, there is no restriction on gap thickness as there is in helium-bonded fuel rods. This opens the possibility of initial gap sizes large enough to significantly delay the onset of pellet-cladding mechanical interaction (PCMI). The large fission-product swelling rate of hydride fuel (3× that of oxide fuel) requires an initial radial fuel-cladding gap of ∼300 m if PCMI is to be avoided. The liquid-metal bond permits operation of the fuel at current LWR linear-heat-generation rates without exceeding any design constraint. The behavior of hydrogen in the fuel is the source of phenomena during operation that are absent in oxide fuels. Because of the large heat of transport (thermal diffusivity) of H in ZrHx, redistribution of hydrogen in the temperature gradient in the fuel pellet changes the initial H/Zr ratio of 1.6 to ∼1.45 at the center and ∼1.70 at the periphery. Because the density of the hydride decreases with increasing H/Zr ratio, the result of H redistribution is to subject the interior of the pellet to a tensile stress while the outside of the pellet is placed in compression. The resulting stress at the pellet periphery is sufficient to overcome the tensile stress due to thermal expansion in the temperature gradient and to prevent radial cracking that is a characteristic of oxide fuel. Several mechanisms for reduction of the H/Zr ratio during irradiation are identified. The first is transfer of impurity oxygen in the fuel from Zr to rare-earth oxide fission products. The second is the formation of metal hydrides by these same fission products. The third is by loss to the plenum as H2.

The review of the fabrication method for the hydride fuel suggests that its production, even on a large scale, may be significantly higher than the cost of oxide fuel fabrication.},

	abstract = {FLiBe is a molten salt made from a mixture of lithium fluoride (LiF) and beryllium fluoride (BeF2). It is both a nuclear reactor coolant and solvent for fertile or fissile material. It served both purposes in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE).
The 2:1 mixture forms a stoichiometric compound, Li2BeF4, which has a melting point of 459 °C, a boiling point of 1430 °C, and a density of 1.94 g/cm3. Its volumetric heat capacity is 4540 kJ/m3K, which is similar to that of water, more than four times that of sodium, and more than 200 times that of helium at typical reactor conditions. Its appearance is white to transparent, with crystalline grains in a solid state, morphing into a completely clear liquid upon melting. However, soluble fluorides such as UF4 and NiF2, can dramatically change the color salt in both solid and liquid state. This made spectrophotometry a viable analysis tool, and it was employed extensively during the MSRE Operations
The eutectic mixture is slightly greater than 50\% BeF2 and has a melting point of 360 °C. This mixture was never used in practice due to the overwhelming increase in viscosity caused by the BeF2 addition in the eutectic mixture. BeF2, which behaves as a glass, is only fluid in salt mixtures containing enough molar percent of Lewis base. Lewis bases, such as the alkali fluorides, will donate fluoride ions to the beryllium, breaking the glassy bonds which increase viscosity. In FLiBe, beryllium fluoride is able to sequester two fluoride ions from two lithium fluorides in a liquid state, converting it into the tetrafluorberyllate ion BeF4−2.},

Almost all of the research reactors safety analyses were, so far, performed using conservative computational tools. Currently, the application of Best-Estimate methods constitutes a real necessity in order to get a more realistic vision of the system behavior, and overcome constraining limits related to conservative approaches. The aim of the current work is an attempt to apply this technique using the system thermal-hydraulic RELAP5/Mod3.2 code. For this purpose, the IAEA 10 MW MTR pool type research reactors Benchmark problem is considered. The exercise consists in performing some fast transients related to typical reactivity induced accidents, and relatively slow transients related to loss of flow accidents. The RELAP5 results were compared against previous data obtained by various conservative channel codes. Differences between the two modeling approaches are afterwards emphasized and discussed.},

In this work, criticality calculation and reactivity changes are presented and discussed using two modelings of the IPR-R1 TRIGA in the MCNP5 code. The first model (Model 1) analyzes the criticality over the reactor. On the other hand, the second model (Model 2) includes the possibility of radial and axial neutron flux evaluation with different operation conditions. The calculated results are compared with experimental data in different situations. For the two models, the standard deviation and relative error presented values of around 4.9 × 10−4. Both models present good agreement with respect to the experimental data. The goal is to validate the models that could be used to determine the neutron flux profiles to optimize the irradiation conditions, as well as to study reactivity insertion experiments and also to evaluate the fuel composition.},

The 10-MW IAEA MTR research reactor was subjected to unprotected reactivity insertion (step and ramp) for both low and high-enriched fuel with continuous reactivity feedback due to coolant and fuel temperature effects. In general, it was found that the power, core mass flow rate and clad temperature under fully established natural circulation are higher for high-enriched fuel than for low enriched fuel. This is unlike the case of decay heat removal, where equal clad temperatures are reported for both fuels. The analysis of reactivity represented by the maximum insertion of positive reactivity (\$0.73) demonstrated the high inherent safety features of MTR-type research reactor. Even in the case of total excess reactivity without scram, the high reactivity feedbacks of fuel and moderator temperatures limit the power excursion and avoid consequently escalation of clad temperature to the level of onset of nucleate boiling and sub-cooled void formation. The code can also be modified to provide an accurate capability for the analyses of research reactor transients under forced convection.},

The reactor is located in the Nuclear Technology Development Center (CDTN), Brazil. It is a 250 kW, light water moderated and cooled, graphite-reflected, open pool type research reactor. The development and the assessment of a RELAP5 model for the IPR-R1 TRIGA are presented. Experimental data were considered in the process of the RELAP5 model validation. The RELAP5 results were also compared with calculated data from the STHIRP-1 (Research Reactors Thermal Hydraulic Simulation) code. The results obtained have shown that the RELAP5 model for the IPR-R1 TRIGA reproduces the actual steady-state reactor behavior in good agreement with the available data.},

	abstract = {This research project provides separate effects tests in order to benchmark neutron kinetics models coupled with thermal-hydraulic (T/H) models used in best-estimate codes such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) RELAP and TRAC code series and industrial codes such as RETRAN. Before this research project was initiated, no adequate experimental data existed for reactivity initiated transients that could be used to assess coupled three-dimensional (3D) kinetics and 3D T/H codes which have been, or are being developed around the world. Using various Test Reactor Isotope General Atomic (TRIGA) reactor core configurations at the Penn State Breazeale Reactor (PSBR), it is possible to determine the level of neutronics modeling required to describe kinetics and T/H feedback interactions. This research demonstrates that the small compact PSBR TRIGA core does not necessarily behave as a point kinetics reactor, but that this TRIGA can provide actual test results for 3D kinetics code benchmark efforts. This research focused on developing in-reactor tests that exhibited 3D neutronics effects coupled with 3D T/H feedback. A variety of pulses were used to evaluate the level of kinetics modeling needed for prompt temperature feedback in the fuel. Ramps and square waves were used to evaluate the detail of modeling needed for the delayed T/H feedback of the coolant. A stepped ramp was performed to evaluate and verify the derived thermal constants for the specific PSBR TRIGA core loading pattern. As part of the analytical benchmark research, the STAR 3D kinetics code (Weader, 1992, STAR: Space and time analysis of reactors, Version 5, Level 3, Users Guide, Yankee Atomic Electric Company, YEAC 1758, Bolton, MA) was used to model the transient experiments. The STAR models were coupled with the one-dimensional (1D) WIGL and LRA and 3D COBRA (Rowe, 1973, COBRA IIIC: A digital computer program for steady-state and transient thermal-hydraulic analysis of rod bundle nuclear fuel elements, Battelle Institute, Richland, WA). T/H models to determine the level of T/H modeling required to accurately describe the behaviour of the PSBR TRIGA core during these transient conditions. STAR's 1D T/H models (WIGL and LRA) were adequate for the rapid pulse events, when accurate temperature-dependent fuel thermal constants were used and the reactor coolant feedback mechanism was small. However, the longer transients (i.e. ramps, square waves) necessitated the use of the COBRA 3D fluid flow analysis coupled with the 3D STAR kinetics model.},

The analysis was performed in the context of a U.S. Department of Energy effort to develop a compendium of informative nuclear fuel cycle performance data. The objective of this paper is to determine whether intermediate spectrum systems, having a majority of fission events occurring with incident neutron energies between 1 eV and 105 eV, perform as well as fast spectrum systems in this fuel cycle. The intermediate spectrum options analyzed include tight lattice heavy or light water-cooled reactors, continuously refueled molten salt reactors, and a sodium-cooled reactor with hydride fuel. All options were modeled in reactor physics codes to calculate their lattice physics, spectrum characteristics, and fuel compositions over time. Based on these results, detailed metrics were calculated to compare the fuel cycle performance. These metrics include waste management and resource utilization, and are binned to accommodate uncertainties. The performance of the intermediate systems for this self-sustaining thorium fuel cycle was similar to a representative fast spectrum system. However, the number of fission neutrons emitted per neutron absorbed limits performance in intermediate spectrum systems.},

	abstract = {In this work, the Monte Carlo burn-up code SERPENT-2 has been extended and employed to study the material isotopic evolution of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR).

This promising GEN-IV nuclear reactor concept features peculiar characteristics such as the on-line fuel reprocessing, which prevents the use of commonly available burn-up codes. Besides, the presence of circulating nuclear fuel and radioactive streams from the core to the reprocessing plant requires a precise knowledge of the fuel isotopic composition during the plant operation.

The developed extension of SERPENT-2 directly takes into account the effects of on-line fuel reprocessing on burn-up calculations and features a reactivity control algorithm. It is here assessed against a dedicated version of the deterministic ERANOS-based EQL3D procedure (PSI-Switzerland) and adopted to analyze the MSFR fuel salt isotopic evolution.

Particular attention is devoted to study the effects of reprocessing time constants and efficiencies on the conversion ratio and the molar concentration of elements relevant for solubility issues (e.g., trivalent actinides and lanthanides). Quantities of interest for fuel handling and safety issues are investigated, including decay heat and activities of hazardous isotopes (neutron and high energy gamma emitters) in the core and in the reprocessing stream. The radiotoxicity generation is also analyzed for the MSFR nominal conditions.

The production of helium and the depletion in tungsten content due to nuclear reactions are calculated for the nickel-based alloy selected as reactor structural material of the MSFR. These preliminary evaluations can be helpful in studying the radiation damage of both the primary salt container and the axial reflectors.},

	abstract = {In the framework of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF-IV), six innovative concepts of nuclear reactors have been proposed as suitable to guarantee a safe, sustainable and proliferation resistant source of nuclear energy. Among these reactors, a peculiar role is played by the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which is the only one with a liquid and circulating fuel. This feature leads to a complex and highly coupled behaviour, which requires careful investigations, as a consequence of some unusual features like the drift of Delayed Neutron Precursors (DNP) along the primary circuit and heat transfer with a heat-generating fluid. The inherently coupled dynamics of the MSRs asks for innovative approaches to perform reliable transient analyses. The node-wise implicitly-coupled solution of the Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that govern the different phenomena in a reactor would offer in this sense an ideal solution. However, such an approach (hereinafter referred to as Multi-Physics – MP) requires a huge amount of computational power. In this work, we propose and assess a Geometric Multiscale approach on MSR, addressing the core modelling with a 3-D MP approach and the remaining part of the system – e.g., the cooling loop – with simplified 0-D models based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). The aim is to conjugate the accuracy of the MP modelling approach with acceptable computation loads. Reference is made to the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), due to the availability of a detailed design and experimental data that are used for assessment and preliminary validation of the developed simulation tool.},

Improved capabilities in ChemTriton include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-zone and multi-fluid systems, enhanced time-dependent feed and separations, and a critical concentration search. Although more generally applicable, the capabilities developed to date are illustrated in this paper in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-based MSR fuel cycle (a likely scenario requires the first of these MSRs to be started without available 233U); (2) determining the effect of the removal of different fission products on MSR operations; and (3) obtaining the equilibrium concentration of a mixed-oxide light-water reactor fuel in a two-stage fuel cycle with a sodium fast reactor. The third problem is chosen to demonstrate versatility in an application to analyze the fuel cycle of a non-MSR system. In the first application, the initial fuel salt compositions fueled with different sources of fissile material are made feasible after (1) removing the associated nonfissile actinides after much of the initial fissile isotopes have burned and (2) optimizing the thorium concentration to maintain a critical configuration without significantly reducing breeding capability. In the second application, noble metal, volatile gas, and rare earth element fission products are shown to have a strong negative effect on criticality in a uranium-fueled thermal-spectrum MSR; their removal significantly increases core lifetime (by 30\%) and fuel utilization. In the third application, the fuel of a mixed-oxide light-water reactor approaches an equilibrium composition after 20 depletion steps, demonstrating the potential for the longer time scales required to achieve equilibrium for solid-fueled systems over liquid fuel systems. This time to equilibrium can be reduced by starting with an initial fuel composition closer to that of the equilibrium fuel, reducing the need to handle time-dependent fuel compositions.},

The main software development is being carried out in the CFDLab (http://cfdlab.ae.utexas.edu) at the University of Texas, but as with other open-source software projects; contributions are being made elsewhere in the US and abroad. The main goals of this article are: (1) to provide a basic reference source that describes libMesh and the underlying philosophy and software design approach; (2) to give sufficient detail and references on the adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening (AMR/C) scheme for applications analysts and developers; and (3) to describe the parallel implementation and data structures with supporting discussion of domain decomposition, message passing, and details related to dynamic repartitioning for parallel AMR/C. Other aspects related to C++ programming paradigms, reusability for diverse applications, adaptive modeling, physics-independent error indicators, and similar concepts are briefly discussed. Finally, results from some applications using the library are presented and areas of future research are discussed.},

Historically, simulation of an entire reactor was accomplished by linking together multiple existing codes that each simulated a subset of the relevant multiphysics phenomena. Recent advances in the MOOSE (Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) framework have enabled a new approach: multiple domain-specific applications, all built on the same software framework, are efficiently linked to create a cohesive application. This is accomplished with a flexible coupling capability that allows for a variety of different data exchanges to occur simultaneously on high performance parallel computational hardware. Examples based on the KAIST-3A benchmark core, as well as a simplified Westinghouse AP-1000 configuration, demonstrate the power of this new framework for tackling—in a coupled, multiscale manner—crucial reactor phenomena such as CRUD-induced power shift and fuel shuffle.},

Once the design life of the IMSR is reached, for example, in the range of 3 to 10 years, it is disconnected, removed and replaced as a unit. The spent IMSR functions as the medium or long term storage of the radioactive graphite and/or heat exchangers and/or control rods and/or fuel salt contained in the vessel of the IMSR. The present also relates to a nuclear reactor that has a buffer salt surrounding the nuclear vessel. During normal operation of the nuclear reactor, the nuclear reactor operates at a temperature that is lower than the melting point of the buffer salt and the buffer salt acts as a thermal insulator. Upon loss of external cooling, the temperature of the nuclear reactor increases and melts the buffer salt, which can then transfer heat from the nuclear core to a cooled containment vessel.},

	abstract = {The family of Generation-IV reactor concepts comprises of multiple promising designs, one of which is the molten salt reactor. These reactors have traditionally been chosen for the possible use of the thorium-uranium fuel cycle and used 7LiF-BeF2 carrier salt. This particular salt choice however presents several challenges due to the cost of highly depleted 7Li isotope for the carrier salt, tritium production, and beryllium toxicity. Additionally, lack of developed and accepted safeguards methodology for thorium fuel cycle presents a barrier. While none of these issues are insurmountable, alternatives are worth investigating. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the more cost effective and regulatory amenable fuel salt choices by using low-enriched uranium fuel in the form of UF4. Several eutectic mixtures are examined that avoid the use of 7Li and Be while maintaining a melting point low enough to be compatible with standard structural materials. The optimal conditions for hexagonal lattice arrangements using nuclear graphite moderation are discussed for multiple fuel salt choices. The aim of this study is to present options of using simpler molten salt reactor alternatives focused on thermal single-fluid low-enriched uranium converter concepts.},

	abstract = {In the paper, the development of a multiphysics model for the transient analysis of non-moderated Molten Salt Reactors is discussed. Particular attention is devoted to the description of the adopted time integration and physics coupling strategies. The proposed model features the adoption of an implicit Runge–Kutta scheme and the coupling among neutron diffusion, Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations for mass and momentum conservation, and energy and delayed neutron precursor balance equations, in order to accurately catch thermal feedbacks on neutronics. The solver is aimed at performing fast-running simulations of the full-core three-dimensional Molten Salt Fast Reactor geometry. The neutronics modelling is assessed against Monte Carlo simulations and the results of a simplified case study are compared to those from multiphysics tools previously developed. As an example of the capability of the model, an unprotected MSFR single pump failure accidental scenario is simulated and discussed. The main purpose of the present model is to serve as fast-running computational tool in the phase of design optimization of fuel loop components. More in general, it is of valuable help in the study of reactor physics of circulating-fuel systems.},

The MAC calculates thermal-hydraulic parameters, namely temperature distribution, flow distribution and pressure drop. The MCNP4c performs the analysis of effective multiplication factor, neutron flux, power distribution and conversion ratio. In this work, the modification of core configuration is achieved by different core zoning and various fuel channel diameters, contributing to flat flux distribution. Specifically, the core is divided into two regions and the effects of different core zoning on the both neutronics and thermal-hydraulic behavior of moderated molten salt reactor are investigated. We conclude that the flat flux distribution cannot always guarantee better performance in thermal-hydraulic perspective and can decreases the graphite lifetime significantly.},

In the heterogeneous approach, minor actinides are loaded in specially designed targets assemblies which are located in the periphery of the core, in order to limit the impacts on core operations. In this paper, we compare the use of uranium and thorium dioxide as support matrix in which minor actinides are diluted in the target assemblies. Both UO2 and ThO2 exhibit sufficiently good irradiation behavior to withstand the long residence time associated with heterogeneous transmutation. Five different reprocessing strategies are compared in which some or all the elements in the blankets are reused after reprocessing. The impacts on core safety parameters and fuel cycle parameters are also evaluated for each case and it is found that using thorium as support matrix with reuse of uranium 233 leads to transmutation performances similar to the one obtained with the reuse of plutonium from uranium blankets with slightly lower global impacts on reactor operation and fuel cycle.},

These initiatives have been virtually brought to a halt for various reasons, except in India, which has continued with its thorium activities.

	abstract = {There is currently a renewed interest in molten salt reactors, due to recent conceptual developments on fast neutron spectrum molten salt reactors (MSFRs) using fluoride salts. It has been recognized as a long term alternative to solid-fueled fast neutron systems with a unique potential (large negative temperature and void coefficients, lower fissile inventory, no initial criticality reserve, simplified fuel cycle, wastes reduction etc.) and is thus one of the reference reactors of the Generation IV International Forum. In the MSFR, the liquid fuel processing is part of the reactor where a small side stream of the molten salt is processed for fission product removal and then returned to the reactor. Because of this characteristic, the MSFR can operate with widely varying fuel compositions, so that the MSFR concept may use as initial fissile load, 233U or enriched uranium or also the transuranic elements currently produced by light water reactors. This paper addresses the characteristics of these different launching modes of the MSFR and the Thorium fuel cycle, in terms of safety, proliferation, breeding, and deployment capacities of these reactor configurations. To illustrate the deployment capacities of the MSFR concept, a French nuclear deployment scenario is finally presented, demonstrating that launching the Thorium fuel cycle is easily feasible while closing the current fuel cycle and optimizing the long-term waste management via stockpile incineration in MSRs.},

	abstract = {The molten salt reactor (MSR), as one of the Generation IV advanced nuclear systems, has attracted a worldwide interest due to its excellent performances in safety, economics, sustainability, and proliferation resistance. The aim of this work is to provide and evaluate possible solutions to fissile 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production and further the fuel transition to thorium fuel cycle in a thermal MSR by using plutonium partitioned from light water reactors spent fuel. By using an in-house developed tool, a breeding and burning (B\&B) scenario is first introduced and analyzed from the aspects of the evolution of main nuclides, net 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production, spectrum shift, and temperature feedback coefficient. It can be concluded that such a Th/Pu to Th/233UTh/233U{\textbackslash}hbox \{Th\}/{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} transition can be accomplished by employing a relatively fast fuel reprocessing with a cycle time less than 60 days. At the equilibrium state, the reactor can achieve a conversion ratio of about 0.996 for the 60-day reprocessing period (RP) case and about 1.047 for the 10-day RP case. The results also show that it is difficult to accomplish such a fuel transition with limited reprocessing (RP is 180 days), and the reactor operates as a converter and burns the plutonium with the help of thorium. Meanwhile, a pre-breeding and burning (PB\&B) scenario is also analyzed briefly with respect to the net 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production and evolution of main nuclides. One can find that it is more efficient to produce 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} under this scenario, resulting in a double time varying from about 1.96 years for the 10-day RP case to about 6.15 years for the 180-day RP case.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) with Th-233U fuel cycle attracts more and more attention with its excellent performance such as desirable breeding capacity, low waste production and high inherent safety. Considering the fact that there is no available 233U in the nature, it is necessary to analyze the fuel transition from enriched 235U/Th to 233U/Th and then give a flexible transition scenario for a graphite-moderated MSR. By employing an in-house developed tool which is based on SCALE6.1, two scenarios, a Breeding and Burning (B\&B) scenario and a Pre-breeding scenario, are studied. The evolution of the inventories of main nuclides, net 233U production and isothermal temperature coefficient are presented and discussed in the B\&B scenario. It is found that the fuel transition can be achieved smoothly by using enriched uranium with greater than 40\% concentration of 235U. The fuel transition can still be accomplished with 20\% enriched uranium but takes a long double time of about 79 years. Meanwhile, we perform an analysis of the Pre-breeding scenario and conclude that it is efficient to produce 233U and the double time ranges from 2.07 years for the 10-day reprocessing to 10.7 years for the 180-day reprocessing. A comparison of these two scenarios is conducted, which indicates that the B\&B scenario is more favorable than the Pre-breeding scenario from the aspect of resource utilization efficiency. Finally, a combined three-stage program for developing Th-based MSRs is proposed.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) were conceived at the early stages of nuclear energy in view of the favourable features fostered by a liquid fuel. They were developed as graphite-moderated thorium-fuelled breeder reactors till the seventies, when studies on this reactor concept were mostly abandoned in favour of the liquid–metal fast breeder concepts. A decade ago, the MSRs were included among the six GEN-IV systems and a core optimization process allowing for the GEN-IV main objectives led toward a fast-spectrum MSR concept (MSFR – Molten Salt Fast Reactor). Albeit advantageous in terms of U-233 breeding and/or radio-active waste burning, the new concept lacks the notable know-how available for the thermal-spectrum MSR technology. The present paper preliminarily investigates the MSR dynamics, based on the conceptual MSFR design currently available. A primary objective is to benchmark two different models of the MSFR primary circuit, both of them including a detailed and fully-coupled (node-wise) representation of turbulent fuel-salt flow, neutron diffusion, and delayed-neutron precursor diffusion and convection. A good agreement is generally observed between the adopted models, though some discrepancies exist in the temperature-field, with ensuing mild impacts on the reactor dynamics. The performed analyses are also used for a preliminary characterization of the MSFR steady-state and accidental transient response. Some points of enhancement needed in the MSFR conceptual design are identified, mainly related to in-core velocity and temperature fields. The reactor response following major accidental transient initiators suggests a generally benign behaviour of this reactor concept.},

	abstract = {Today's nuclear technology has principally been based on the use of fissile U-235 and Pu-239. While the natural thorium isotope Th-232 can finally be transformed to a fissile U-233 nucleus following a thermal neutron capture reaction, the existence of thorium in the nature and its potential use in the nuclear technology were not unfortunately into account with a sufficient importance. This was probably because of the geological availability of natural resources of thorium and uranium. Global distributions of thorium and uranium reserves clearly indicate that in general some developed countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia have considerable uranium reserves and contrarily only some developing countries such as Brazil, Turkey, India, Egypt have considerable thorium reserves as being totally about 70 \% of the global reserve. All technical parameters obtained from the studies on thorium fuel cycle during the last 50 years indicate that thorium fuel cycle can be used in most of reactor types already operated. In addition, accelerated-driven hybrid systems promise to use the thorium based nuclear fuels. So, thorium will probably be a nuclear material much more valuable than uranium in the future. For this reason, all developing countries having thorium reserves should focus their technological attentions to the evaluation of their national thorium resources like in the case of India. In this paper a brief story on the studies of thorium and its potential use in the future energy production technology have been summarized.},

This paper gives an overview of the international R\&D efforts on these reactor types carried out in the framework of Generation-IV. Many countries worldwide contribute to this reactor technology, among which the European Union, France, Japan, Russia and the USA, and for the past few years China and India have also contributed. In general, the international R\&D focuses on three main lines of research. The USA focuses on the FHR, which will be a nearer-term application of liquid salt as a reactor coolant, while China also focuses on solid fuel reactors as a precursor to molten salt reactors with liquid fuel and a thermal neutron spectrum. The EU, France and Russia are focusing on the development of a fast spectrum molten salt reactor capable of either breeding or transmutation of actinides from spent nuclear fuel. Future research topics focus on liquid salt technology and materials behavior, the fuel and fuel cycle chemistry and modeling, and the numerical simulation and safety design aspects of the reactor. MSR development attracts more and more attention every year, because it is generally considered as most sustainable of the six Generation-IV designs with intrinsic safety features. Continuing joint efforts are needed to advance common molten salt reactor technologies.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are liquid-fuel reactors, in which the fuel is also the coolant and flows through the core. A particular configuration presented in this paper called the Molten Salt Fast Reactor consists in a Molten Salt Reactor with no moderator inside the core and a salt composition that leads to a fast neutron spectrum. Previous studies showed that this concept (previously called Thorium Molten Salt Reactor – Nonmoderated) has very promising characteristics. The liquid fuel implies a special reprocessing. Each day a small amount of the fuel salt is extracted from the core for on-site reprocessing. To study such a reactor, the materials evolution within the core has to be coupled to the reprocessing unit, since the latter cleans the salt quasi continuously and feeds the reactor. This paper details the issues associated to the numerical coupling of the core and the reprocessing. It presents how the chemistry is introduced inside the classical Bateman equation (evolution of nuclei within a neutron flux) in order to carry a numerical coupled study. To achieve this goal, the chemistry has to be modeled numerically and integrated to the equations of evolution. This paper presents how is it possible to describe the whole concept (reactor+reprocessing unit) by a system of equations that can be numerically solved. Our program is a connection between MCNP and a homemade evolution code called REM. Thanks to this tool; constraints on the fuel reprocessing were identified. Limits are specified to preserve the good neutronics properties of the MSFR. In this paper, we show that the limit rate for the reprocessing is 2.5l of fuel salt a day, which means that the fuel should be reprocessed within 7000days approximately if there is a specific way to control the redox potential of the salt. Finally, a last part of this paper analyzes the impact of chemical parameter uncertainties on the reprocessing performance.},

	abstract = {The IMSR uses molten fluoride salt, a highly stable, inert liquid with robust coolant properties and high intrinsic radionuclide retention properties, for its primary fuel salt. A secondary, coolant salt loop, also using a fluoride salt (but without fuel), transfers heat away from the primary heat exchangers integrated inside the core-unit. The coolant salt loop, in turn, transfers its heat load to a solar salt loop, which is pumped out of the nuclear island to a separate building where it either heats steam generators that generate superheated steam for power generation or is used for process heat applications. The safety philosophy behind the IMSR is to produce a nuclear power plant with generation IV reactor levels of safety. For ultimate safety, there is no dependence on operator intervention, powered mechanical components, coolant injection or their support systems, such as electricity supply or instrument air in dealing with upset conditions. This is achieved through a combination of design features: the inert, stable properties of the salt; an inherently stable nuclear core; fully passive backup core and containment cooling systems; and an integral reactor architecture.},

	abstract = {A new fuel cycle analysis code named FAMOS was developed for molten salt reactor (MSR) applications by extending the DIF3D code to model the transport of delayed neutron precursors and by coupling the extended DIF3D code with an in-house multi-channel thermal-hydraulics solver and an in-house nuclide depletion solver for the simulation of fuel depletion, reprocessing and feeding. FAMOS can also calculate the effective delayed neutron fraction accounting for the motion of fuel salt, the neutron generation time and the reactivity feedback coefficients. In order to verify the FAMOS code, the molten salt fast reactor (MSFR) proposed in the EVOL (Evaluation and Viability of Liquid Fuel Fast Reactor System) project was analyzed using FAMOS and the calculation results were compared with the reported results. The numerical results indicate that FAMOS is capable of simulating the fuel cycle process of MSRs with good accuracy. FAMOS was applied to the fuel cycle analysis of the molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) as well. The effects of the temperature distribution and the drift of delayed neutron precursors on the neutronics characteristics and fuel cycle performances of MSBR were evaluated using three different calculation models. The drift of delayed neutron precursors and the temperature distribution shift the axial power distribution upward and downward, respectively, and the latter effect is stronger than the former one. However, the impacts of the temperature distribution and the drift of delayed neutron precursors on the depletion and buildup behaviors of actinides and fission products in MSRs are negligible. It is also possible to achieve a 233U conversion ratio larger than 1.0 without protactinium removal and thus to operate the MSBR by only feeding 232Th, except for the initial start-up stage.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from biomass combustion are traditionally assumed climate neutral if the bioenergy system is carbon (C) flux neutral, i.e. the CO2 released from biofuel combustion approximately equals the amount of CO2 sequestered in biomass. This convention, widely adopted in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of bioenergy systems, underestimates the climate impact of bioenergy. Besides CO2 emissions from permanent C losses, CO2 emissions from C flux neutral systems (that is from temporary C losses) also contribute to climate change: before being captured by biomass regrowth, CO2 molecules spend time in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. In this paper, a method to estimate the climate impact of CO2 emissions from biomass combustion is proposed. Our method uses CO2 impulse response functions (IRF) from C cycle models in the elaboration of atmospheric decay functions for biomass-derived CO2 emissions. Their contributions to global warming are then quantified with a unit-based index, the GWPbio. Since this index is expressed as a function of the rotation period of the biomass, our results can be applied to CO2 emissions from combustion of all the different biomass species, from annual row crops to slower growing boreal forest.},

Traditionally these reactors are thought of as thermal breeder reactors running on the thorium to 233U cycle and the historical competitor to fast breeder reactors. In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in molten salt reactors, which have been considered in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum, because of their several potentialities and favorable features when compared with conventional solid-fueled reactors. MSRs meet many of the future goals of nuclear energy, in particular for what concerns an improved sustainability, an inherent safety with strong negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, stable coolant, low pressure operation that don not require expensive containment, easy to control, passive decay heat cooling and unique characteristics in terms of actinide burning and waste reduction, while benefiting from the past experience acquired with the molten salt technology. As the only liquid-fueled reactor concept, the safety basis, characteristics and licensing of an MSR are different from solid-uranium fueled light water reactors. In this paper, a historical review of the major plant systems in MSR is presented. The features of different safety characteristics of MSR power plant are reviewed and assessment in comparison to other solid fueled light water reactors LWRs.},

Two types of MSR concepts were studied and developed in parallel, namely the MSR with liquid fuel and that with solid fuel. Abundant fundamental research including the neutronics modeling, thermal-hydraulics modeling, safety analysis, material investigation, molten salts technologies etc. were carried out. Some analysis software such as COUPLE and FANCY were developed. Several experimental facilities like high-temperature fluoride salt experiment loop have been constructed. Some passive residual heat removal systems were designed, and 1 test facility is under construction. The key MSR techniques including the extraction and separation of molten salt and construction of N-base alloy have been mastered. Based on these fundamental research, Chinese Academy of Sciences has completed the design of thorium-based MSRs with solid fuel and liquid fuel and is promoting their construction in the near future. In China, future efforts should be paid to the material, online fuel processing, Th-U fuel cycle, component design, and construction and thermal-hydraulic experiments for MSR, which are rather challenging nowadays.},

The fluid fuel in these reactors, consisting of UF4 and ThF4 dissolved in fluorides of beryllium and lithium, is circulated through a reactor core moderated by graphite. Technology developments over the past 20 years have culminated in the successful operation of the 8-MW(th) MoltenSalt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), and have indicated that operation with a molten fuel is practical, that the salt is stable under reactor conditions, and that corrosion is very low. Processing of the MSRE fuel has demonstrated the MSR processing associated with high-performance converters. New fuel processing methods under development should permit MSR’s to operate as economical breeders. These features, combined with high thermal efficiency (44\%) and low primary system pressure, give MSR converters and breeders potentially favorable economic, fuel utilization, and safety characteristics. Further, these reactors can be initially fueled with 233U, 235U, or plutonium. The construction cost of an MSBR power plant is estimated to be about the same as that of light-water reactors. This could lend to power costs 0.5 to 1.0 mill/kWh less than those for light-water reactors. Achievement of economic molten-salt breeder reactors requires the construction and operation of several reactors of increasing size and their associated processing plants.},

Both codes allow explicit geometric representation of the target systems and are used internationally for safety analyses involving fissile materials. KENO V.a has limiting geometric rules such as no intersections and no rotations. These limitations make KENO V.a execute very efficiently and run very fast. On the other hand, KENO-VI allows very complex geometric modeling. Both KENO codes can utilize either continuous-energy or multigroup cross-section data and have been thoroughly verified and validated with ENDF libraries through ENDF/B-VII.0, which has been first distributed with SCALE 6. Development of the Monte Carlo solution technique and solution methodology as applied in both KENO codes is explained in this paper. Available options and proper application of the options and techniques are also discussed. Finally, performance of the codes is demonstrated using published benchmark problems.},

	abstract = {The CNRS has been involved in molten salt reactors since 1997. Starting from the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor project of Oak-Ridge, an innovative concept called Molten Salt Fast Reactor or MSFR has been proposed, resulting from extensive parametric studies in which various core arrangements, reprocessing performances and salt compositions were investigated to adapt the reactor in the framework of the deployment of a thorium based reactor fleet on a worldwide scale. The primary feature of the MSFR concept is the removal of the graphite moderator from the core (graphite-free core), resulting in a breeder reactor with a fast neutron spectrum and operated in the Thorium fuel cycle. MSFR has been recognized as a long term alternative to solid fuelled fast neutron systems with unique potential (negative safety coefficients, smaller fissile inventory, easy in-service inspection, simplified fuel cycle…) and has thus been selected for further studies by the Generation IV International Forum in 2008.In the MSFR, the liquid fuel processing is part of the reactor where a small side stream of the molten salt is processed for fission product removal and then returned to the reactor. This is fundamentally different from a solid fuel reactor where separate facilities produce the solid fuel and process the Spent Nuclear Fuel. Because of this design characteristic, the MSFR can thus operate with widely varying fuel composition. Thanks to this fuel composition flexibility, the MSFR concept may use as initial fissile load, {\textless}sup{\textgreater}233{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}U or enriched (between 5\% and 30\%) uranium or also the transuranic elements currently produced by PWRs in the world.Our reactor’s studies of the MSFR concept rely on numerical simulations making use of the MCNP neutron transport code coupled with a code for materials evolution which resolves the Bateman’s equations giving the population of each nucleus inside each part of the reactor at each moment. Because of MSR’s fundamental characteristics compared to classical solid-fuelled reactors, the classical Bateman equations have to be modified by adding two terms representing the reprocessing efficiencies and the fertile or fissile alimentation. We have finally coupled neutronic and reprocessing simulation codes in a numerical tool develop to calculate the evolution of the whole MSFR system. This tool is used to evaluate the extraction capacities of fission products and their location in the whole system (reactor and reprocessing unit), basis of any safety and radioprotection assessment of the reactor., Le CNRS s’intéresse aux réacteurs à sels fondus (RSF) depuis 1997. Dans le but de proposer un réacteur critique basé sur le cycle thorium pour la production d’énergie, des études plus complètes sont menées à partir de 1999. Une réévaluation complète du MSBR qui constituait alors la configuration de référence des RSF est tout d’abord effectuée, suivie d’une étude systématique d’optimisation du comportement de ce type de réacteurs en s’éloignant du design initial. Ces travaux ont permis de faire émerger un concept de réacteur innovant, qui a été sélectionné fin 2008 par le Forum International Generation IV comme représentant type des réacteurs à sels fondus et qui a désormais comme dénomination officielle : MSFR (Molten Salt Fast Reactor). Il s’agit d’un concept de réacteur surrégénérateur à spectre neutronique rapide et en cycle Thorium, qui présente une très bonne stabilité intrinsèque de fonctionnement grâce à des coefficients de sûreté tous négatifs, et un processus de retraitement du combustible in-situ simplifié acceptable d’un point de vue économique. Ce réacteur se place dans le contexte d’une filière d’utilisation du Thorium qui est un élément fertile abondant dans la nature, en association avec des éléments fissiles naturels ({\textless}sup{\textgreater}235{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}U) ou non ({\textless}sup{\textgreater}233{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}U) ou encore qui proviennent de la chaine de gestion des éléments radioactifs à vie longue des réacteurs actuels (Np, Pu, Am, …).Les études menées sont basées sur le couplage du code de transport de neutrons MCNP avec le code d’évolution des matériaux REM développé au CNRS. La résolution des équations de Bateman qui est effectuée permet de connaître la population de chaque noyau dans chaque partie du réacteur à chaque instant. Du fait des caractéristiques fondamentales des RSF qui sont très différentes de celles des réacteurs à combustible solide, ces équations doivent être modifiées pour prendre en compte la capacité d’alimentation en matière fissile et fertile, ainsi que le retraitement du sel combustible, de manière continue sans arrêt du réacteur. Nous avons finalement associé le code décrivant l’évolution du coeur et une représentation simulée du retraitement pour construire un outil numérique servant au calcul de l’évolution du système complet. Cet outil permet d’évaluer l’efficacité du retraitement vis-à-vis de l’ensemble des produits de fission (en supposant une efficacité donnée pour le procédé physicochimique utilisé), ainsi que de déterminer leur localisation dans le système. Ces informations sont essentielles pour pouvoir aborder une étude de la sûreté ou de la radioprotection du système.},

	abstract = {We discuss here the concept of Thorium Molten Salt Reactor dedicated to future nuclear energy production. The fuel of such reactors being liquid, it can be easily reprocessed to overcome neutronic limits. In the late sixties, the MSBR project showed that breeding is possible with thorium in a thermal spectrum, provided that an efficient pyrochemical reprocessing is added. With tools developed around the Monte Carlo MCNP code, we first re-evaluate the performance of a MSBR-like reference system with 232Th/233U fuel. We find an important reduction of inventories and induced radiotoxicities at equilibrium compared to other fuel cycles, with a doubling time of about thirty years. We then study how to start this interesting reference system with theplutonium from PWR spent fuel. Such a transition appears slow and difficult, since it is very sensitive to the fissile quality of the plutonium used. Deployment scenarios of 232Th/233U MSBR-like systems from the existing French PWRs demonstrate the advantage of an upstream 233U production in other reactors, allowing a direct start of the MSBR-like systems with 233U. This finally leads us to explore alternatives to some MSBR features, for energy production with 232Th/233U fuel from the start. We thus test different options, especially in terms of core neutronics optimization and reprocessing unit adaptation.},

	abstract = {The adoption of Th fuel in fast reactors is being reconsidered due to the potential favorable impact on actinide waste management and resource availability. A closed Th cycle leads to an actinide inventory with lower radiotoxicity and heat load for the first several thousands of years. Due to the typically low TRansUranic (TRU) Conversion Ratio (CR), Th can also be advantageous to expedite the consumption of legacy TRU. One of the main obstacles to the implementation of Th is the highly radioactive recycled fuel which requires remote handling under heavy shielding, inevitably penalizing economics and challenging conventional pin-based fuel manufacturing. From this perspective, the development of liquid-fuelled reactors, with Molten Salt Reactors regarded as the most promising, appears particularly attractive as fuel handling would be greatly simplified. The present paper investigates the fuel cycle performances of the reference GEN-IV Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) in terms of isotope evolution, radiotoxicity generation and safety-related parameters. Similarly to most MSR concepts proposed in the past, the MSFR is based on the fluoride molten salt technology, but it features the novelty of a fast neutron spectrum. Calculations are performed using state-of-the-art equilibrium-cycle methodologies, i.e., the ERANOS-based EQL3D procedure developed at the Paul Scherrer Institut and extended to the simulation of the MSFR. Selected results have been benchmarked with the Monte Carlo code PSG2/SERPENT. These results have also been used for the assessment of a diffusion module based on the COMSOL multi-physics toolkit, which is the subject of current studies aimed at efficiently simulating the peculiar MSFR transient behavior.},

MOSART is one of conceptual designs in the molten salt reactor (MSR) category of the Generation-IV systems. This type of reactors is distinguished by the use of liquid fuel circulating in and out of the core, which offers many unique advantages but complicates the modeling and simulation of core behavior using conventional reactor physics codes. The TRITON control module in SCALE6 can perform reliable depletion and decay analysis for many reactor physics applications due to its problem-dependent cross-section processing and rigorous treatment of neutron transport. In order to accommodate a simulation of on-line refueling and reprocessing scenarios, several in-house programs together with a run script were developed to integrate a series of stepwise TRITON calculations; the result greatly facilitates the neutronics analyses of long-term MSR operation. Using this method, a detailed reexamination of the MOSART operation in 30years was performed to investigate the neutronic characteristics of the core design, the change of fuel salt composition from start-up to equilibrium, the effects of various salt reprocessing scenarios, the performance of actinide transmutation, and the radiotoxicity reduction.},

The analysis is based on neutronics calculations and focuses on denatured MSR systems. Resource utilization and basic proliferation-risk attributes are compared to those of standard light-water reactors. Depending on specific design choices, even fully denatured reactors could reduce uranium and enrichment requirements by a factor of 3–4.

Compared with uranium, the standard reactor fuel, thorium is more abundant and harder to divert to weapons production, and it yields less radioactive waste. But thorium can't simply be swapped in for uranium in standard reactors. Taking up the engineering gauntlet, several nations are pursuing thorium reactors in which the fuel is dissolved in a bath of molten salt. India, meanwhile, plans to have a power reactor using solid thorium fuel running within 10 years.

Presently the country has stepped into the 2nd Stage. The transition from the Stage 1 to 2 was fruitful thanks to the 2-decade long R\&D experience gained in Fast Reactor Fuel Reprocessing (FRFR). Closing the fast reactor fuel cycle through FRFR was inevitable for the success of the Indian Nuclear Power Program (INPP). The latest achievement by the center was the successful reprocessing of 100 GWd/t burnup mixed carbide fuel with 70\% Pu, discharged from the Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) which is also located in the same center. The designs of the various equipments and process flow sheet had stemmed from the above experiences thereby increasing the confidence level in the future plans of the Department. In this paper, an overview of the experiences in FRFR with glimpses of the various developmental activities towards the future plants is spelt out.},

Good decontamination is obtained in the fluorination step due to the low volatility of most of the fission product fluorides. An over-all decontamination factor greater than 106 with adequate uranium recovery has been demonstrated in laboratory scale tests using a double bed procedure for the NaF step. A pilot plant has been constructed for testing the process with various heterogeneous fuel elements. The engineering and operational features of the pilot plant are described.},

Based on the MSRE and MSBR concepts developed by ORNL in the 60s which involve a liquid fuel constituted of fluorine molten salt at a temperature close to 600°C, new developments with innovative approach and technology have been realized which contribute to strongly improve the concept. The thorium breeder potentiality is closely related to the use of a liquid fuel which is able to be periodically treated. A reprocessing scheme has been established to treat used fuel by extraction of fission products. According to the Gen IV philosophy for closed cycle nuclear reactor, the actinides are sent back in the reactor core. In this way, the wastes radiotoxicity is strongly decreased and the use of natural resource is optimized. This paper describes an innovative reactor concept, the TMSR-NM (non-moderated thorium molten salt reactor), from the nuclear physic point of view and the different steps involving in the reprocessing scheme from the chemical point of view.},

The matrices are generated once using the Monte Carlo neutron transport MCNP prior to the kinetic calculations. This article is devoted to the description of this approach with two different sets of equations depending on the aimed precision. We tested the TFM approach in several instances. In the calculation of the kinetic parameters such as βeff and Λeff on the Flattop and Jezebel experiments, the results obtained are compatible with adjoint weighted calculations performed with the Monte Carlo neutron transport code SERPENT. Likewise, our calculated value of the αRossi observable is also compatible with the experimental measurement. Finally a time–space prompt neutron propagation induced by a neutron pulse on Flattop has been calculated using the TFM approach and compared to a reference time dependent SERPENT calculation. Again, the results obtained demonstrate the good characterization of the time–space system response by the TFM approach.},

	shorttitle = {Advanced online fuel reprocessing simulation for thorium-fueled molten salt breeder reactor},
	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and MSR concepts has enhanced demand in building the tools to analyze these systems. This thesis introduces a Python script, SaltProc, which simulates MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt. SaltProc couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT 2, for neutron transport and depletion calculations. SaltProc capabilities include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-region and multi-flow systems, time-dependent feeds and removals, and specific separation efficiency for each element or isotope removal flow. Generally applicable capabilities are illuminated in this thesis in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-fueled MSBR fuel cycle to find equilibrium fuel composition (when multiplication factor of the full-core model and the U-233 concentration in the fuel salt are invariant in time); (2) determining the effect of the fuel salt irradiation with online reprocessing on MSBR operations; and (3) estimating MSBR fuel cycle performance by computing the Th-232 feed rate over 20 years of operation and comparing with available data. In the first application, full-core depletion in the MSBR demonstrated that (1) equilibrium fuel composition could be achieved after 16 years and (2) the multiplication factor stabilizes after 6 years of operation. In the second application, fuel salt irradiation with simulated fission product removal and fissile/fertile feed causes considerable neutron energy spectrum hardening; this spectral shift has a problematic impact on safety parameters (e.g., temperature reactivity feedback, reactivity control system worth). In the third application, the average Th-232 feed rate throughout 20 years of operation is 2.39 kg/day or 100 g/GWh(e) which is a good agreement with other recent research. Problematic effects of neutron energy spectrum hardening during MSBR operation should be taken into account for neutronics, multi-physics, and fuel cycle performance analysis.},

	abstract = {The fuel cycle performance and core design of the Transatomic Power liquid-fueled molten salt reactor concept is analyzed. This advanced reactor concept uses configurable zirconium hydride moderator rod assemblies to shift the neutron spectrum in the core from intermediate at beginning of life to thermal at end of life. With a harder spectrum during the early years of reactor operation, this spectral shift design drives captures in fertile 238U. The converted fissile plutonium makes up over 50\% of the fissile material in the fuel salt over the last half (∼15 years) of reactor operation. A softer spectrum late in reactor life helps drive the fuel to a burnup of 90 GWd/MTU. Continuously changing physics necessitates time-dependent analyses resolved over long timescales (i.e., months to years), as this concept does not meet an equilibrium condition. The spectral shift and molten salt reactor material feeds and removals enable this concept to perform better in fuel cycle metrics, increasing resource utilization by more than 50\% compared with a typical light water reactor (i.e., from ∼0.6\% to ∼1\%). These metrics are compared to similar fuel cycles using alternate technologies. Additional core design and analysis challenges associated with the spectral shift and use of molten salt reactor technology are identified and discussed.},

The reactor and the processing plant are planned as an integral system. The main functions of the processing plant will be to isolate 233Pa from the neutron flux and to remove the rare-earth fission products. The processing method being developed involves the selective chemical reduction of the various components into liquid bismuth solutions at 600°C, utilizing multistage counter-current extraction. Protactinium, which is easily separated from uranium, thorium, and the rare earths, would be trapped in the salt phase in a storage tank located between two extraction contactors and allowed to decay to 233U. Rare earths would be separated from thorium by a similar reductive extraction method; however, this operation will not be as simple as the protactinium isolation step because the rare-earth-thorium separation factors are only 1.3 to 3.5. The proposed process would employ electrolytic cells to simultaneously introduce reductant into the bismuth phase at the cathode and to return extracted materials to the salt phase at the anode. The practicability of the reductive extraction process depends on the successful development of salt-metal contactors, electrolytic cells, and suitable materials of construction.},

The performed neutronics studies demonstrate that REBUS-3700 gathers a positive breeding gain and strong negative salt expansion reactivity feedback. The safety analysis demonstrates an excellent reactor behavior with respect to the majority of single and combined unprotected events. The work also reveals the necessity to get more accurate nuclear data for the chlorine isotopes and to investigate the reactor configuration with radial fertile blanket. It seems also indispensable to realize more detailed thermo-hydraulic calculations and especially to perform a sizeable R\&D program on structure material capable to resist the corrosion induced by chlorides.},

The former is based on the point kinetics equations with six groups of delayed neutrons and the lumped capacitance heat transfer equations. To account for the reflector effect on neutron lifetime, additional (fictional) groups of delayed neutrons are added in the point kinetics equations to represent the thermalized neutrons coming back from the reflectors. The latter is based on coupled multi-group neutron diffusion and finite element heat transfer model. Multi-group cross sections and diffusion coefficients are generated using the Monte Carlo code Serpent and defined as input in COMSOL 5.0.},

	abstract = {The technological base for high-temperature reactors is the graphite-matrix coated-particle fuel that can operate at temperatures approaching 1250EC with allowable accident temperatures approaching 1600EC. Historically, the reactor coolant has been helium. However, another reactor coolant is also compatible with graphite-based fuels: molten fluoride salts. Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, and the University of California at Berkeley are developing a new reactor concept, the Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (AHTR), which uses graphite-matrix coated-particle fuel with a clean high-temperature, low-pressure molten-fluoride-salt reactor coolant. The molten salt has a boiling point near 1400EC. Recent studies have developed a preconceptual design for 2400-MW(t) AHTR. Two outlet coolant temperatures were evaluated: 800 and 1000EC. The low pressure and high-temperature output matches the need for heat to produce hydrogen using thermochemical production techniques or electricity at high efficiency. While the AHTR uses the same coated-particle fuels as those used in helium-cooled reactors, the difference in coolant characteristics and reactor design will likely change some of the fuel requirements. The superior heat transfer characteristics of liquid molten salts compared with those of gaseous helium reduces peak fuel operating temperatures. The decay-heat-cooling system reduces peak accident temperatures by several hundred degrees Celsius. The ability of the molten salt to absorb fission products reduces those fuel quality requirements necessary to minimize off-site radiation exposures under accident conditions. Because more fuel blocks must be moved during a refueling outage, the larger power output of the AHTR implies longer refueling times if the fuel has the same geometry and power densities as modular gas-cooled reactor fuel. Consequently, there are strong economic incentives to increase the power density, increase fuel burnup, and modify the fuel geometry to reduce refueling times. Neutronic requirements may require other modifications as well.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactor (MSR) shows great promise of high thermal-electric conversion efficiency, inherent safety, and on-line reprocessing. Furthermore, fuel breeding can be realized in both thermal and fast spectrum reactors with Th-U fuel cycle, which can make use of the abundant resource of thorium. In order to combine the advantages of high breeding ratio (BR) in fast spectrum and low fissile inventory for criticality in thermal spectrum, a single-fluid double-zone thorium-based molten salt reactor (SD-TMSR) core configuration is proposed. First, assemblies in both the inner and the outer zones are optimized by adjusting the ratios of molten salt and graphite with consideration of BR, 233U inventory, double time (DT), and temperature coefficient of reactivity (TCR) at the startup time, aiming to have a minimal DT for fuel breeding and a negative TCR for security. The results show that DT has the optimum value when the ratios of molten salt and graphite in the inner zone and the outer zone are 0.357 and 1.162, respectively. And the TCR can be improved to −2 pcm/K when the side length of the graphite hexagonal prism is 7.5 cm. Then, based on the optimized geometry, the burn-up calculations with a series of on-line reprocessing rates are carried out with a self-developed MSR reprocessing sequence (MSR-RS). The results show that on-line reprocessing is beneficial to the Th-U fuel breeding. When the reprocessing rate is 200 l/d, iso-breeding can be achieved. When the reprocessing rate is 5 m3/d, the performance of Th-U breeding is improved significantly, and only 16 years is needed for the 233U doubling. The results also show that TCR remains negative and inherent safety is satisfied during all the operation time.},

To further develop these MSR concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled MSR depletion and fuel processing. However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-fidelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing. This paper introduces a Python package, SaltProc, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2 to simulate MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of MSR fuel salt. This work demonstrates SaltProc capabilities for a full-core, high-fidelity model of the commercial Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) concept and verifies these results to results in the literature from independent, lower-fidelity analyses.},

In this paper, the feedback coefficient and the breeding ratio are optimized based on the fuel-to-graphite ratio variation for a thorium based MSR (TMSR). A certain thermal core with negative feedback coefficient and relative high initial breeding ratio is chosen for the reprocessing scheme analysis. The breeding performances for the TMSR under different online fuel reprocessing efficiencies and frequencies are evaluated and compared with other MSR concepts. The results indicate that the thermal TMSR can get a breeding ratio greater than 1.0 with appropriate reprocessing scheme. The low fissile inventory in thermal TMSR leads to a short doubling time and low transuranic (TRU) inventory. The lifetime of graphite used for the TMSR is also discussed.},

	abstract = {In circulating fuel reactors, such as the Molten Salt Reactor, the fuel circulates throughout the reactor instead of being immobile as in solid fuel reactors. The vast majority of nuclear simulation codes are primarily designed to simulate solid fuel reactors. Hence, many features unique to circulating fuel reactors, such as fuel injection and removal, cannot be properly modeled with these codes. The work presented here focuses on developing a numerical simulation package that can effectively and accurately model these reactors. This package consists of the coupling of the Monte Carlo particle transport code OpenMC with a modified version of ORIGEN-S, and uses a novel algorithm that calculates the optimal fuel injection and removal schemes for such reactors to achieve certain conditions such as a stable reactivity. We demonstrate our code’s accuracy by benchmarking the coupling module with the MCODE coupling code, and by simulating the operation of the ORNL Denatured Molten Salt Reactor using the coupling and fuel injection modules. The resulting fuel injection scheme is in agreement with the original study of that reactor while offering a much finer resolution for the injection scheme over time. This work is part of a broader project to develop an open-source neutronics code for circulating fuel reactors that will couple OpenMC with an in-house open-source depletion module.},

A centrifugal separator was used as the bubble separator, taking advantage of the kinetic energy of fluid to create a centrifugal force to separate gas bubbles from the mixture flow. Both the bubble generator and the separator were demonstrated to have good potential to meet the performance requirements of an off-gas removal system for a small TMSR. With water and air as the working fluids, for the final designs of the two key pieces of equipment, a liquid flow rate exceeding 15 m3/h can essentially make their performance meet the requirements of the off-gas removal system in terms of the average size of the generated bubbles and gas separation efficiency.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the economic factors that drive nuclear power load-following in future European electricity systems. A power plant dispatching model is built to simulate deregulated markets, in order to identify to what extent additional flexibility is needed from nuclear power due to more renewables. We contribute to the literature with an economic perspective of the nuclear load-following by means of numerical simulations of several European power systems that will pursue the nuclear policy in 2050. Results show that intermittency would make flexible nuclear reactors cycling more often and retire earlier. The highest requirements for flexibility would be in systems with high shares of nuclear, renewables or coal-fired plants (Central-Western Europe and certain Central-Eastern European countries) and in systems with low grid interconnections (Western Europe and South-West). Load-following implies lower capacity factors for nuclear plants, except for Central-Western Europe where operating flexibly would allow reactors to supply more output than in steady-state mode. The lowest generation cost is found in Nordic countries where most of the flexibility is provided by hydro-units, and hence nuclear power plants operate mostly baseload. Ensuring flexibility becomes financially interesting when nuclear power plants are not the marginal technology setting the clearing price; in this way the infra-marginal rent allows operators to capture high revenues. It is shown that nuclear flexibility is profitable from a broader social welfare perspective, such as safe baseload units' operation, renewables' integration, system operators' balancing, and consumer's price.},

	abstract = {The Molten Salt Fast Reactor is a fast-spectrum molten salt reactor under development in the framework of the European H2020 SAMOFAR Project (http://samofar.eu/). Among the design peculiarities, this circulating fuel reactor features a helium bubbling system aimed at removing on-line gaseous fission products, and metallic particles as well. From a modelling point of view, the presence of helium bubbles in the core needs to be assessed both from a neutronics and thermal-hydraulics point of view. In this paper, the attention is paid to the first aspect, analysing the void reactivity effect induced by the bubbles by means of a Monte Carlo, an SP3 neutron transport and a neutron diffusion approach. Since the distribution of helium bubbles is not uniform in the core but strongly depends on the fuel salt flow conditions, as well as on the location of their injection and extraction, a coupling scheme between Serpent 2 and OpenFOAM codes is adopted for the Monte Carlo analysis. In this way, the Monte Carlo code Serpent 2 is provided with a real bubble distribution calculated by means of a two-phase Euler-Euler solver implemented in OpenFOAM. The outcome puts in evidence the difference arising when a uniform and a real distribution of bubbles is considered in a Monte Carlo calculation. These results are also compared with an SP3 neutron transport and a neutron diffusion solver implemented in OpenFOAM, highlighting the difference among the three neutronics approaches herein adopted.},

	abstract = {Wind and solar power are known to be highly influenced by weather events and may ramp up or down abruptly. Such events in the power production influence not only the availability of energy, but also the stability of the entire power grid. By analysing significant amounts of data from several regions around the world with resolutions of seconds to minutes, we provide strong evidence that renewable wind and solar sources exhibit multiple types of variability and nonlinearity in the time scale of seconds and characterise their stochastic properties. In contrast to previous findings, we show that only the jumpy characteristic of renewable sources decreases when increasing the spatial size over which the renewable energies are harvested. Otherwise, the strong non-Gaussian, intermittent behaviour in the cumulative power of the total field survives even for a country-wide distribution of the systems. The strong fluctuating behaviour of renewable wind and solar sources can be well characterised by Kolmogorov-like power spectra and q-exponential probability density functions. Using the estimated potential shape of power time series, we quantify the jumpy or diffusive dynamic of the power. Finally we propose a time delayed feedback technique as a control algorithm to suppress the observed short term non-Gaussian statistics in spatially strong correlated and intermittent renewable sources.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactor (MSR) concepts are being actively developed by several private companies, with some touting the fuel cycle benefits of this technology. Simulating the deployment of MSRs and their effect on fuel cycle transitions is the role of a system dynamics fuel cycles tool. However, many current fuel cycles tools have difficulty modeling MSR isotopic variations because they were designed for modeling existing reactors based on discrete fuel elements with batch fueling schemes (i.e., charge and discharge). This work presents ORION fuel cycle modeling results using a specific high power density fast spectrum MSR design. For code verification, a single-stage MSR fuel cycle was set up in ORION and results were compared with the results from the SCALE-based reactor physics model (ChemTriton). A transition scenario was set up in ORION from the current light water reactor fleet to a future fleet of MSRs to study the characteristics of an MSR that affect its performance during transition. Several transition scenarios were set with holds and delays in place that are representative of a sodium fast reactor as modeled in Evaluation Group 23 for the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign Evaluation and Screening Study. Several MSR characteristics lend to its high performance and ease in transition from the current fuel cycle: fissile material is only loaded at initial startup; all fissile material is available as it is bred due to online fuel processing; and fissile material recirculating through the core is briefly held in tanks for processing and has very minimal out-of-core time (on the order of a minutes to a few days). These characteristics are in contrast to a solid-fueled reactor, which requires discharge, cooling, and fabrication of fuel all of which could take a few months to a few years and repeated loading of fresh fuel assemblies. A solid-fueled reactor only discharges a fraction of a core every year.},

	abstract = {Fluoride High-temperature Reactors (FHRs) are regarded for their high temperature output and passive decay heat rejection. Small Modular Advanced High Temperature Reactor (SmAHTR), a 125 MWth reactor falls under the FHR group. Along with FHRs, SmAHTR also uses multilayered, high accident tolerant TRistructural ISOtropic (TRISO) fuel kernels. Despite the reactor’s benefits due to its high efficiency and safety parameters, its considerably higher fuel costs compared to traditional UO2 fuel creates a drawback. To mitigate this problem and use the fuel more efficiently, lower fraction of fuel can be loaded into the core, however the resulting cycle length may be prohibitively short. This study proposes a spectral shift scheme to improve both the discharge burnup and the cycle length simultaneously for these types of reactors. Our analyses include both the neutronic and the thermal hydraulics (T/H) assessment for the non-spatial implementation of this scheme under single- and multi-batch scheme operation. The safety performance, i.e. reactivity coefficients and T/H limits, for this concept is comparable to the original design. The results confirm that performance benefits of more than 32\% compared to the original design are achievable.},

All the zirconium hydrides prepared in the present study showed CaF2 type δ ZrH2−x. The lattice parameter slightly increased with the hydrogen content. The thermal expansion coefficients of the zirconium hydrides evaluated from high-temperature X-ray diffraction data were larger than that of zirconium metal and increased with the hydrogen content. The longitudinal and shear sound velocities of the zirconium hydride were slightly different from those of zirconium metal, which enabled us to estimate the elastic properties. The zirconium hydride had higher elastic moduli than zirconium metal and the elastic moduli slightly depended on the hydrogen content. The microhardness of the zirconium hydride was much higher than that of zirconium metal and decreased with increasing hydrogen content.

	abstract = {The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is engaged in work to develop a fuel processing system that enables load-following in Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), an important ability that allows nuclear power plants to ramp electricity production up or down to meet changing electricity demand. Nuclear reactions in MSRs produce unwanted byproducts (such as xenon and krypton) that can adversely affect power production. In steady, baseload operation, these byproducts form and decay at the same rate. When electricity production is ramped down, however, the byproducts start to be produced at a greater rate than they decay, leading to a buildup within the reactor. When power production must be once again increased, the response rate is slowed by the time needed for the byproducts to reach their equilibrium level (determined by the radioactive decay half-life, which is on the order of hours). Thus, buildup of these unwanted byproducts resulting from ramping down inhibit proper load following for molten salt reactors. Fortunately, MSRs transport fuel in a flowing molten salt fuel loop, which means that a section of the reactor, outside the core, can be leveraged for fuel processing and "cleanup." The team will determine the feasibility of removal of these unwanted byproducts and de- sign a fuel reprocessing system, removing a major barrier to commercialization for molten salt reactors.

Toward this work, we initiated the Fuel Cycle Simulation task (Task 2) in August 2018 to more realistically model the online reprocessing system of the Transatomic Power (TAP) MSR. A Python toolkit, SaltProc v0.1 [1–3], was developed to represent the simplified online fuel salt processing of a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR). More recently, an advanced SaltProc version (SaltProc v0.2) was developed to generically simulate complex molten salt fuel reprocessing systems, including the TAP system, incorporating user-parametrized components into the fuel salt processing design. This report summarizes the progress we have made towards milestone M2.1: Demonstrate SaltProc and the steps toward the subsequent Task 2 objectives.},

	abstract = {Liquid-fueled nuclear reactors, particularly molten salt reactors (MSRs), have recently gained significant interest in the advanced reactor community. As with all reactors, modeling and simulation are critical to advanced reactor design and licensing and will be required for MSR deployment. However, there are significant gaps in existing simulation capabilities for MSRs, particularly with the unique challenges of liquid-fueled systems (e.g., fission product transport). Furthermore, advanced reactor designers require near-term tools that are readily modifiable to perform design and analysis, including the ability to extend their analysis beyond the primary system to auxiliary systems. Transient Simulation Framework of Reconfigurable Models (TRANSFORM), a Modelica-based, system modeling library developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is an advanced tool that can help meet some of the near-term needs of the advanced reactor community. This paper describes advanced system modeling criteria and presents TRANSFORM to the advanced reactor community by demonstration of system modeling capabilities and support of advanced analysis workflows, i.e., the Risk Analysis Virtual Environment (RAVEN) framework from Idaho National Laboratory, using the liquid-fueled Molten Salt Demonstration Reactor (MSDR) as a reference design.},

	abstract = {The Generation-IV consortium seeks to develop a new generation of nuclear energy systems for commercial deployment by 2020–2030. These systems include both the reactors and their fuel-cycle facilities. The aim is to provide significant improvements in economics, safety, sustainability, and proliferation resistance. The systems selected for development are the very high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (VHTR), the sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR), the gas-cooled fast reactor (GFR), the lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR), the molten salt reactor (MSR) and the super-critical water-cooled reactor (SCWR). UK organisations plan to contribute to the first three of these systems because of its existing capabilities and experience with gas-cooled systems, graphite cores, and SFRs. The science base for the VHTR and SFR systems is reasonably established, although there are gaps. For the VHTR, these include the performance of graphite at high neutron doses, and the performance of the fuel. For the SFR, the behaviour of fuels containing minor actinides, and processes for their recycling and refabrication into new fuel, must be established. The GFR presents many technical challenges, because it would need fuel and structural materials capable of withstanding extremes of fast neutron flux and high temperatures. Adequate heat removal from the core under fault conditions is likely to determine its feasibility.},
