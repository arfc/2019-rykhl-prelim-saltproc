In the search for new ways to generate carbon-free, reliable 
base-load power, interest in advanced nuclear energy technologies, 
particularly \glspl{MSR}, has resurged with multiple new companies 
pursuing \gls{MSR} commercialization. To further develop these \gls{MSR} 
concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled 
\gls{MSR} depletion and fuel processing. However, current nuclear reactor 
physics software is unable to perform depletion calculations for 
reactor systems with online separations and feeds. This work proposes to 
develop a Python package, SaltProc. SaltProc couples 
with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2 to realistically simulate a generic 
\gls{MSR} online reprocessing system by modeling the changing isotopic 
composition of \gls{MSR} fuel salt. Current models in the literature 
assumed ideal extraction efficiencies. This work will implement mechanical 
and chemical 
models of fuel processing components appearing in various 
\gls{MSR} schemes. 
SaltProc capabilities will be demonstrated and validated for a few 
promising liquid-fueled \gls{MSR} designs with different fuel salt 
composition, neutron spectra and reprocessing schemes.
