In the search for new ways to generate carbon-free, reliable 
base-load power, interest in advanced nuclear energy technologies, 
particularly \glspl{MSR}, has resurged with multiple new companies 
pursuing \gls{MSR} commercialization. To further develop these \gls{MSR} 
concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled 
\gls{MSR} depletion and fuel processing. However, current nuclear reactor 
physics software is unable to perform a depletion calculations for a 
reactor systems with online separations and feeds. This work proposes to 
develop a Python package, SaltProc, which couples 
with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2 to realistically simulate a generic 
\gls{MSR} online reprocessing system by modeling the changing isotopic 
composition of \gls{MSR} fuel salt. The SaltProc package will enable 
the simulation of neutron poisons extraction based on physics- and 
chemistry-driven correlations rather than assuming ideal 
removal efficiency. A few perspective liquid-fueled 
\gls{MSR} concepts among various fuel cycles, number of salts
(single- and two-fluid), neutron spectra and reprocessing schemes 
will be investigated to demonstrate and validate proposed simulation 
package.
