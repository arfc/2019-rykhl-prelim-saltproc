\section{Reprocessing plant general concept}
All liquid-fueled \gls{MSR} designs involve varying levels of online fuel processing. Minimally, volatile gaseous fission products (e.g. Kr, Xe) escape from the fuel salt during routine reactor operation and must be captured. Additional systems might be used to enhance removal of those elements. Most designs also call for the removal of rare earth metals from the core since these metals act as neutron poisons. Some designs suggest a more complex list of elements to process (figure~\ref{fig:periodic_tab}), including the temporary removal of protactinium from the salt or other regulation of the actinide inventory in the fuel salt \cite{ahmad_neutronics_2015}. This section 
contains general chemical processing plant and gas separation system brief 
overview. As an example of generic reprocessing facility the reprocessing plant 
of single-fluid \gls{MSBR} was selected.

\subsection{Gas separation system}
Volatile gaseous fission products (e.g. Kr, Xe) must be removed from the fuel salt 
to avoid reactor poisoning especially during starup and power maneuvering. This is 
particularly true for $^{135}$Xe, with its very large neutron capture cross section 
(2.65$\times$10$^6$ b). Tritium, xenon, and krypton are sparged from the fuel salt by 
helium introduced in a bypass stream by a bubble generator and subsequently removed 
by a gas separator (figure~\ref{fig:gas_removal_system}). Indeed, noble gases, because of their exceptional insolubility 
in the salt, will migrate promptly to any gaseous interface available. Because 
they form ideal-dilute mixture in salt (obey Henry's law), they will migrate in 
accordance with the conventional laws of mass transfer. If tiny helium bubbles 
are circulated with the fuel salt, they will absorb xenon and krypton fission 
products. The fission-product-rich bubbles of helium may then be separated from 
the salt and discharged to the off-gas system. Xenon migration to the circulating 
bubbles is in competition with xenon migration to the porous moderator graphite. 
The graphite is especially of concern because it absorbs xenon and holds it in the 
core which leads to parasitic neutron absorption. The 0.5\% target value for 
$^{135}$Xe poison fraction can be achieved when circulating helium bubbles 
0.508mm in diameter \cite{robertson_conceptual_1971}. This is accomplished by 
bypassing 10\% of the fuel salt from the pump discharge through a bubble separator 
to remove the xenon bubbles and then back into the pump suction. The average 
residence time of a bubble in the fuel loop would be 10 full cycles. Investigation 
for \gls{MSBR} has shown that helium babble size was approximately 25\% of the 
throat width (blue circle on figure~\ref{fig:bubble_separator}) and was independent 
of the gas flow rate \cite{robertson_conceptual_1971}. Consequently, it is possible 
to regulate helium bubble size by changing throat width in the bubble generator.

To inform physics-based simulation of volatile gases removal in  
computational code a mathematical model is required. Particularly, xenon 
extraction efficiency is needed to accurately model $^{135}$Xe removal in 
a fuel salt 
depletion simulations. The gain and loss terms for dissolved in fuel salt 
xenon-135 atomic density are listed in tables~\ref{tab:xe_gain}, \ref{tab:xe_loss}. 
The stripping 
efficiency for the pump bowl has been measured during \gls{MSRE} but \gls{ORNL} report only states range of it (from 50 to 100\%) and mentioned that the results are not 
accurate \cite{kedl_development_1967}. $^{135}$Xe burnup and 
decay rates are relatively well known and can be estimated using neutronics 
computer code. The mass transfer coefficient can be estimated from CFD-models but 
there is lack of published information to inform accurate mathematical model. 
Previous research by \gls{ORNL} \cite{kedl_development_1967, engel_xenon_1971} has 
concluded that efficiency of xenon removal ($\epsilon_{Xe}$) in gas separation 
system is a function of many parameters:
\begin{align}
\epsilon_{Xe} = F (A, d_{He}, \dot{m}_{He}, \dot{m}_{salt}, h_b, T)
\end{align}
where $A$ is interface area of injected helium bubbles, $d_{He}$ is average diameter 
of helium bubbles, $\dot{m}_{He}$ is helium gas mass flow rate, $\dot{m}_{salt}$ is 
salt mass flow rate, $h_b$ is mass transfer coefficient for transferring xenon into 
circulating helium bubbles, $T$ is the salt temperature.

Similar removal techniques and relationship for removal efficiency would be 
appropriate 
for other noble gases (e.g. Kr) but coefficients for different gases would be 
different. To create realistic mathematical model medium-fidelity correlations with 
coefficients for various volatile gases (but xenon is in focus) are needed. It can be 
done experimentally or using CFD simulations. Current effort at University of 
 Illinois at Urbana-Champaign namely ``Enabling Load Following Capability in the 
Transatomic Power MSR" \cite{huff_enabling_2018} has a goal to determine those 
correlations using CFD simulations 
and verify it in small-size experiments. Obtained mathematical model might be used 
to inform realistic physic-based gases removal from fuel salt in proposed SaltProc 
tool.

\subsection{Fuel salt chemical processing facility} \label{sec:chemical_processing}
In the single-fluid \gls{MSBR} thorium, uranium, 
protactinium, and fission products are all mixed together in a single fluoride salt (FLiBe). Separation of thorium from lanthanide (atomic numbers 57 through 71) fission products is rather challenging because of their chemical similarities. The principal scheme of \gls{MSBR} reprocessing facility concept is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:material_flow}. The fuel salt is first temporarily stored for cooling and decay of the shortest lived fission products, then directed to the primary fluorinator, where most of the uranium is removed by fluorination to UF$_6$. After that, the salt is routed to an extraction column where mixture containing metallic bismuth, lithium and thorium as reductants are contacted with the salt. The remaining uranium and protactinium are reductively extracted to the bismuth, leaving a salt that only contains fission products dissolved in carrier salt (base composition of LiF-BeF$_2$-ThF$_4$). The salt then goes through a reduction column where UF$_6$ is reduced to UF$_4$ in the salt, refueling it and preparing it for return to the reactor. Refill BeF$_2$ and ThF$_4$ are also added and all residual bismuth is removed from the salt. After a final cleanup step and valence adjustment, the purified salt returns to the reactor \cite{carter_design_1972,sorensen_one-fluid_2006}.
\begin{figure}[htp!] % replace 't' with 'b' to 
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{flowsheet.pdf}
  \caption{Simplified block diagram of chemical processing scheme for single-fluid \gls{MSBR} \cite{robertson_conceptual_1971, sorensen_one-fluid_2006}.}
  \label{fig:material_flow}
\end{figure}

The bismuth accommodating some uranium and protactinium is routed to a hydrofluorination column where the metallic solutes in the bismuth are oxidized into their fluoride forms in the presence of a decay salt. The decay salt, containing UF$_4$, PaF$_4$, and ThF$_4$ passes into a decay tank where $^{233}$Pa is decays to $^{233}$U. The uranium generated by protactinium decay is removed through fluorination to UF$_6$ and directed to the reduction column to refuel the purified fuel salt. A hydrofluorinator and a fluorinator can remove approximately \textbf{95\%} of the uranium from the stream.

The fully processed salt, on its way back to the reactor, has uranium added from the protactinium decay tank at the rate required to maintain or adjust the uranium concentration in the reactor (and, consequently, control the reactivity). This is performed by sparging the salt with UF$_6$ and hydrogen to produce UF$_4$ in the salt and HF gas \cite{robertson_conceptual_1971}.

The fuel salt stream from the protactinium isolation system contains only traces of protactinium and uranium (because it were separated in the system) but contains practically all of the rare earths. A share of this salt stream is bypassed to a reductive extraction process for removing rare earths. This method for rare-earth removal is based on differences in the extent to which the rare earths and thorium distribute between molten salt and liquid bismuth containing a reductant. Principal scheme of Rare Earths removal system is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rare-earth-removal}. A molten salt flow which contains rare-earth fluorides is fed to the center of an extraction column. The salt flows countercurrent to a liquid bismuth stream which contains thorium and lithium. In the upper part of the column, a large fraction of the rare earths is reduced and transfers to the downflowing liquid metal stream. Below the feed point rare earths concentration is increased in the salt and metal streams in order to produce a concentration hight enough for disposal \cite{briggs_molten-salt_1969}.

Molten salt leaving the top of the column contains low concentration of rare earths. Fraction of this flow is returned back to the reactor while the rest is sent to an electrolytic cell complex. The net effect of the complex is to push thorium and lithium into bismuth for use as extractant and to return extracted rare earths, entering the complex with bismuth from the bottom of the cascade, to the cascade as reflux, oxidizing them out of the metal and transferring them to the returning salt stream.

Electrolytic oxidizer-reducer is required for reducing lithium and thorium fluorides into a bismuth cathode to prepare the metal streams fed to the extraction columns and for oxidizing extracted components from the metal streams leaving the columns \cite{mcneese_engineering_1971}. The electrolytic-cell complex consists of an electrolytic
cell with contactors above and below it. Both the anode and the cathode of the cell are pools of flowing bismuth, and the electrolyte is salt that does not contain large amounts of rare earths or thorium. The cathode feeds lithium to the bismuth stream that flows into the
lower contactor and extracts essentially all ($\approx$ 99\%) of the thorium out of the feed stream. The anode puts BiF$_3$ into the salt that flows into the upper contactor and oxidizes all of the rare earths out of the entering bismuth.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Rare Earths Separation Efficiency} \label{sec:rare_earth_eff}
Rare earth removal efficiencies were calculated during Molten Salt Reactor Experiment for a range of operating conditions to establish the importance of number of stages, separation factor, metal-to-salt flow ratio, rare earth concentration in the discard stream, location of the feed point, and the fraction of ThF$_4$ which is reduced in the electrolytic oxidizer-reducer. The thorium and lithium concentrations in the bismuth stream fed to the extraction column were both 0.0016 mole fraction. 
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \begin{center}

    \end{center}
    \caption{Metal-to-Salt Volumetric Flow Ration in Opper Column (24-stage column) \cite{briggs_molten-salt_1969}.}
    \label{fig:vol-flow-ratio}
\end{figure}

The optimum feed location was at the center of the column and all results to is for this feed
location. System performance is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:vol-flow-ratio} for a range of Metal-to-Salt flow ratios and for rare-earth-thorium separation factors from 1.2 to 6. The fraction of the ThF$_4$ which is reduced in the electrolytic cell was 99\%. Operation with a bismuth flow rate of 15 gpm will result in a rare earth removal efficiency of 69\% (44-day removal time) for a separation factor of 2 and a removal efficiency of 31\% (95-day removal time) for a separation factor of 1.5.

The effect of fraction of ThF$_4$ reduced in the electrolytic cell is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:th-reduction}. A significant decrease in removal efficiency results from the fraction of ThF$_4$ reduced being decreased from 99 to 90\%, and the system becomes ineffective if less than 50\% of the ThF$_4$ is reduced.  The separation factors are 1.3 for Eu, 1.7 for Pm, 1.8 for La, 2.0 for Sm, 3.0 for Nd, and 3.5 for Ce. The removal times range from about 225 days for Eu to 30 days for Nd and Ce (Table~\ref{tab:removal_time}).

\hline Rare  & Separation & Removal Time                        \\

\hline Pm          & 1.7				& 63.8 					\\
\hline Nd		   & 3.0                & 30.6 					\\

\hline 
\end{tabular}
  		\label{tab:removal_time}
\end{table}

The rare earth, which determine the operating conditions for the removal system is promethium (which has a separation factor of 1.7), since it is the strongest neutron absorber. Lanthanum is less important, and the resulting removal time ($\approx$100 days) is satisfactory.
The removal times for rare earths having separation factors greater than 2, such 
as neodymium and cerium, will be shorter than required.

Overall, based on experimental data from \gls{MSRE} chemistry-based mathematical 
models can be formulated for rare earths separation efficiency. The analysis above 
shown that efficiency of specific rare earth removal ($\epsilon_{RE}$) in chemical 
processing plant is a function of many parameters:
\begin{align}
\epsilon_{RE} = F (A, \dot{m}_{Bi}, \dot{m}_{salt}, N, K)
\end{align} 
where $A$ is a metal-to-salt interface area, $\dot{m}_{Bi}$ is bismuth mass 
flow rate, $\dot{m}_{salt}$ is salt mass flow rate, $N$ is the number of stages, 
$K$ is mass transfer coefficient at the salt / Bi-Li interface. 
This mathematical correlations can be used to inform realistic chemistry-based 
depletion simulations with proposed SaltProc tool.

\section{SERPENT overview}
SERPENT is a continuous-energy Monte Carlo neutronics software capable of solving the neutron transport problem by tracking individual neutrons within the problem geometry and using stochastic method to determine chain of events for each neutron \cite{leppanen_serpent_2015}. SERPENT has been under active development at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland since 2004, where it was initially conceived as a tool to simplify group constant generation in a high-fidelity Monte Carlo environment. SERPENT is now widely used transport code  with a growing user base. Now SERPENT used by more than 500 registered individuals in 155 organizations located in 37 countries around the world. The burnup calculation capability in SERPENT is based on built-in calculation routines, without using any external solvers. A restart feature allows performing fuel shuffling or applying any modifications in the input by dividing the calculation into several parts, which is crucial for online reprocessing simulations.

The latest version, SERPENT 2, supports advanced geometries and has advanced burnup capabilities, including online refueling capabilities which are necessary for neutronic computations of pebble-bed reactors and liquid-fueled \glspl{MSR} \cite{aufiero_extended_2013}. Unfortunately, built-in online refueling features are still under active development and unavailable to ordinary users. Furthermore, recently multi-physics simulations using SERPENT 2 were demonstrated, i.e. coupled calculations with thermal-hydraulics, \gls{CFD} and fuel performance codes \cite{leppanen_numerical_2015}. Two-way coupling to thermal-hydraulics, \gls{CFD}, and fuel performance codes operates on two levels: internal coupling to built-in solvers for fuel behavior and thermal-hydraulics, and external coupling via a universal multi-physics interface. 

SERPENT 2 can be effectively run in parallel on computer clusters and multi-core workstations. Parallelization is handled by thread-based OpenMP, which has the advantage that all processsors use shared memory space. Calculations can be divided into several nodes by distributed-memory \gls{MPI} parallelization. SERPENT 2  is an improvement upon SERPENT 1, and contains a complete redesign of memory management using hybrid OpenMP \cite{dagum_openmp_1998} + \gls{MPI} parallelization.  This hybrid parallelization is important in depletion calculations using computer clusters with multiple nodes, and allows to achieve significant speed-up in depletion calculations on computer clusters with more than 4'000 cores \cite{leppanen_serpent_2015}. 

All calculations herein were performed using SERPENT 2 version 2.1.30 on Blue Waters’ XE6 nodes. For cross section generation, JEFF-3.1.2 nuclear data library was employed \cite{oecd/nea_data_bank_jeff-3.1.2_2014}.
