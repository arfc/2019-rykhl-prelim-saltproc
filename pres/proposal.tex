		\begin{itemize}
                        \item \gls{MOOSE} application developed at \gls{UIUC} 
                                in the \gls{ARFC} group by lead developer Dr. 
                                Alexander Lindsay
                        \item Neutron flux modeled with multigroup diffusion
                        \item Delayed neutron precursor drift is incorporated
                        \item Alongside fuel advection
                        \item Gamma heating
                        \item 2D-axisymmetric and 3D multiphysics results are presented
                        \item Demonstrated strong parallel scaling (up to 384 physical cores) 
                \item Further optimization is required for improved scaling.
